 Command:
         RECORD;
 	
 RECORD writes  the  following information  to  a user  specified  file
 (defaults to  PS:<USER-DIR>RECORD.LOG.-2 :  Date  and time,  TTY  line
 number, program  name, cpu  time, username,  and connected  directory.
 Note that a  temporary file is  created and deleted  on the  directory
 PS:<TEMP>.
 	
 The intended purpose of the command is to gather usage statistics  for
 a given user group.   It can accomplish this  by the insertion of  the
 command:
 	
 	RECORD <a-statistics-directory>
 	
 into the  logout.cmd file  on the  users directory  or on  a  superior
 directory of the user.  This will cause the statistics to be  appended
 to the file RECORD.LOG.-2 on the directory.
 
 	Use as a Statistics Mechanism for user group UU
 	
 For this to work properly, the  protection codes of the various  files
 and directories involved must be:
 	
      <UU>		    DIRECTORY PROTECTION 774000 (access for users
 	      		         UU.* controlled by file protection codes)
 
      <UU>LOGOUT.CMD	    FILE PROTECTION 774000      (read access only)
 
      <UU.RECORD>	    DIRECTORY PROTECTION 774000
 
      <UU.RECORD>USED.CPU  FILE PROTECTION 770400 (append access by UU.*)
 	
 and  insert  the  line  "RECORD  <UU.RECORD>USED.CPU"  into  the  file
 LOGOUT.CMD on the directory PS:<UU>.
 	
 This  arrangement  prevents  the   users  UU.*  from  corrupting   the
 statistics gathered insofar  as possible. A  malicious user could  use
 the command  RECORD from  his  terminal without  logging out  and  add
 entries to the record file  appearing  to  have gotten more  CPU  than
 really was used, but no user can remove entries from  the  record file
 once they have been made.
 
 However, if the user  creates a file LOGOUT.CMD  in his own  directory
 and neglects to include a RECORD  command therein, his usage will  not
 be trapped.
 
 
 The statistics file must already exist on <UU.RECORD> since the user's
 access to it is controlled by the file protection code rather than the
 directory protection code. Therefore if the file is migrated, it  must
 be recreated.
 
 The USED.CPU file may be analyzed by the Fortran program REPORT.
 
 Note that this command will not work properly if it is invoked from  a
 TAKE file, but it does work ok from an indirect file.
