COMMAND library;
!------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Purpose:
!	Update a load library by replacement of one or more routines using
!	MAKLIB.
!
! Usage:
!	LIBRARY libname modulelist
!
! Remarks:
!	Libname is a standard file specifier with default extension ".REL".
!	Modulelist is a list of one or more files (default extension ".REL")
!	whose names are the same as the modules they contain.  Each specified
!	module will be replaced in the library and an index to the library
!	will be reconstructed.  The intermediate replacements are done in
!	files named "SCR:libname.MKL"; the final indexed library will be
!	one generation higher of the original library, and will be in the
!	same directory as the original library.
