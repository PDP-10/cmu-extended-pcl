 Command:
         SEND
 
Purpose:
	To do the parsing for the "SEND.EXE" file in a convenient fashion.
	The PCL just passes everything it parses to the executable program
	through the rescan buffer.
 
Usage:
	SEND (to) <destination list> <text string or CRLF>
   or	SEND /READ:<dérectory>
 
	    The destination list is a list of line numbers, usernames,
	and/or directories. They are seperated by comma's. A line number
	sends to the specified terminal, if there is a job on it and if
	it is a real terminal (not a PTY). The directory specification
	appends a message to that directory's ACJ.MSG file. A username
	sends the message to all of the user's jobs that are logged
	in on "real" terminals. If he doesn't have any jobs, then the
	message is appended to his directories ACJ.MSG .
 
	    The /READ displays messages sent to a directory.
 
	    If a null destination list is given (i.e. just a "send" and a
	CRLF are typed), then the executable program parses it's own 
	destinations.
 
	    If a text string is typed in, then that is used as the message,
	otherwise the executable program parses a multi-line message terminated
	with a CNTRL/Z.
