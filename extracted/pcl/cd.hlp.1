The @CD command does a smart connect to an other directory:
 - if there is an UNCONNECT.CMD file it takes it,
 - it  connects to  the destination,  clears the  screen and  does  an
information about Job,
 - it defines the logican name HERE: as the ãonneãted äirecôory,
 - if there is a CONNECT.CMD directory it takes it.

Remarks:
	This command may  be particularly useful  in conjunction  with
the commands in the LOGICAL library.
