1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Programmable Command Language
  The  PCL  Extension to the TOPS-20 EXEC puts a language and executor into the
TOPS-20 EXEC.  With this high level language  and  its  extensions,  users  can
easily  to write their own PCL programs which will will look like existing TOPS
commands complete with parameter substitution and TOPS-20 style recognition.

  PCL is due to Ray SCOTT from Carnegie Mellon University Computation Center:  
Carnegie-Mellon University,
Computation Center,
Schenley Park
5000 Forbes Avenue,
Pittsburgh  PA 15213 (phone +1.412.578-26-42).

  This manual describes an extended version of PCL, with extensions by Michel E
Debar: FNDP Computing Centre, Rue Grandgagnage, 21 B-5000 Namur Belgium  (phone
+32.81.22-06-31, telex 59.222 Fac.Nam. B. Belgium).

  You  should consult the "TOPS-20 PROGRAMMABLE COMMAND LANGUAGE - User's Guide
and Reference Manual" from CMU for the complete documentation of  the  official
(non  extended)  version  of  PCL.  (That manual is on our distribution tape in
<pcl5.doc>pcl.lpt. The present manual is in <pcl5.x-doc>pclx.lpt.  )

1.2. PCL Uses
  PCL may be used in a variety of different ways.  Users might  write  friendly
front  ends to existing programs.  The command parsing with recognition makes a
very easy way to do parameter passing to a program.    Periodic  or  repetitive
tasks  can  be  coded  in  PCL routines which would reduce the amount of typing
needed to accurately execute all the steps necessary to  complete  a  piece  of
production.

  PCL also will provide a means for implementing completely new functions which
are  not possible in the current EXEC.  For example, if the user has a graphics
terminal which takes special support then  PCL  can  be  used  to  provide  new
support commands.

  System  administrators  can  tailor their EXEC to provide local commands that
override the function of standard commands.    An  administrator  may  wish  to
eliminate the PLOT command if there is no plotter on the system.

1.3. PCL Features
  The main features of PCL are:

   - ALGOL-like language constructs

   - string manipulation

   - callable procedures with parameters

   - system services

   - flexible user interface

   - program interface

   - input/output capabilities

1.4. Notational conventions
  In this document the format of commands is given using simple conventions:

   - [...] is used to denote an optional item.

   - "integer1  [,integer2  ...]"  denotes one more integers, separated by
     commas.

   - {option1 | option2} denotes alternative items.



2. EXEC INTERFACE
  PCL  commands  can  be  written  with  any text editor.  The source for these
commands is stored in files with the  default  type  PCL.    Source  files  are
compiled  into a command by the new EXEC command DECLARE .  Once the command is
successfully compiled, it is stored in the EXEC and becomes a part of the  list
of  commands  that  the  user  has  available  during that job.  If the DECLARE
command detects an error in the PCL source, an error message will be  typed  on
the  terminal along with the line in error and a pointer indicating about where
the error occurred.  Once an error is detected the compilation  stops  at  that
point.

  Any  user command which has the same name as an existing command overlays the
existing command.  The new EXEC command ORIGINAL may be used to execute any  of
the  standard  EXEC  commands.    Commands  may  be  removed with the UNDECLARE
command.

  In addition to declaring PCL commands, the user may use the  DECLARE  command
to declare procedures which may be called from user commands, string variables,
and  integer  variables.    One  PCL  source  file  may  contain  many command,
procedure, and variable declarations.  The variables may  be  given  values  by
using the SET command with the new options STRING-VARIABLE or INTEGER-VARIABLE.
For example:

        @SET STRING-VARIABLE myname (TO) scott

  The  string  variable  MYNAME  may  be  accessed from any declared command or
procedure.

  A new option to the INFORMATION command, the PCL-OBJECTS  option,  will  show
the user all user defined commands, procedures, and variables.

        @INFORMATION (ABOUT) PCL-OBJECTS
        Commands: DRP, REMIND, NETMAILCHECK, DIALUPLINE, COURIER
        Procedures: MATCH
        Variables: String MYNAME, Integer MYJOB

  Once  the  user  has  a  set of procedures and commands defined, these may be
saved in an ENVIRONMENT using  the  ENVIRONMENT  option  to  the  new  PRESERVE
command.    To  recall  an  environment,  use  the  DECLARE  command  with  the
ENVIRONMENT option.  Commands and procedures in environment files are stored in
an internal format, so they are not recompiled when declared.    The  user  may
declare  multiple ENVIRONMENT files and the commands from each environment will
be added to the user's EXEC command list. Commands (re)defined  are  listed  on
the user terminal unless you use the /NOCONFIRM option of DECLARE.



3. THE PCL LANGUAGE

3.1. General Command Format
  The formal definition of a command is :

        COMMAND name;
               PCL statement

  A simple example would be:  

        COMMAND simple;
        Display "This is a simple command";

If the above 2 lines were in the file simple.pcl then 

        @DECLARE PCL simple.pcl

would enter the command simple into the users EXEC.  If the user types:  

        @SIMPLE

at the "@" prompt then 

        This is a simple command

would be typed on the user's terminal.

  The most general (and useful) simple definition of a command is:

        COMMAND name;
        Begin
           [INTEGER, STRING and EXTERNAL declarations]
           PCL-Statement;
           [...;]
           End

where  any number of PCL statements separated by semi-colons may be between the
BEGIN-END pair. Note that all Integer,  String  and  External  statements  must
appear before any other PCL statement.

  Begin...End  may  be used to group any number of PCL statements into a single
statement. Note that braces {...} may be used in lieu of Begin..End:  

        if i > 100 then begin
           display "Out of Range";
           i = 50;
           end;

  Statement labels may be up to 40 characters long and are  terminated  with  a
colon.    Labels  are used by the GOTO statement (see page 32) and by the parse
error handler (see page 11):  

        if i gtr 100 then goto horror;
        ...
        Horror:
           display "Can't proceed";
           exit;

  Comments may be placed anywhere in PCL source files.

  Simple comments start with an exclamation mark and extend to the end  of  the
current line:  

        Display "Hi" +          !This is a comment
                " Mate";

  Inline  Comments  are enclosed between !{...}!. They may appear in the middle
of a line, they may extend over several lines and they may be nested.    Inline
comments  are  useful for commenting out large sections of code, long comments,
and in-line commenting:

        !{  Ring the
            terminal Bell }!

        call $Jsys1 ( 8%74 !{pbout}!, 8%7);

3.2. PCL Constants
  PCL knows of only two types of constants: integers and strings.

  Integers are signed integers (expressed  as  36  bit  quantities).    Integer
constants are of the form:  

        Format 1.
                number
        Format 2.
                base%number

The  first form is a number in base 10. The second form allows to enter numbers
in any base from 2 to 36. For bases higher than 10 the letters "a" through  "z"
are used to enter the digits 10 through 35:  

        12              (decimal)
        8%14            (octal)
        16%C            (hexadecimal)
        8%777777777777  (actually -1)

  The  system  procedures  $string  and $integer are used to convert numbers to
strings and back, with an optional radix.

  Strings are of the form "string". They may be freely concatenated  using  the
"+"  operator. Presently string constants are limited to 512 characters. String
variables do not have that restriction.

3.3. PCL Variables
  PCL has two types of variables: string and integer variables.  Variables  may
be either local to a procedure or global.

  Variables to be used in PCL commands must be declared at the beginning of the
command.  For example:  

        COMMAND simple;
        BEGIN
         STRING name_in_full;
         INTEGER count;
         EXTERNAL INTEGER screen_size;
          ...
        END

would define the local variables name_in_full (string) and count (integer), and
give the procedure access to a global variable screen_size (integer).  Variable
names  may  be  any  combination  of  letters,  numbers,  and  the  under-score
character.  Names may be up to 40 characters in length.

  Variables may be assigned values using a simple assign statement.  

        COMMAND simple;
        BEGIN
         STRING name_in_full;
         INTEGER count;
         count = 3;
         name_in_full = "J. Ray Scott";
          ...
        END

  Local variables are known only within the command or procedure in which  they
are declared.

  Global  variables  are  known  to any procedure which declares them external.
They may be manipulated either by PCL commands, or by the Exec commands:  

        @DECLARE INTEGER-VARIABLE or
        @DECLARE STRING-VARIABLE       (see page 25)

        @SET INTEGER-VARIABLE or
        @SET STRING-VARIABLE           (see page 51)

        @INFORMATION (about) VARIABLE variable_name
                                        (see page 35)

If they are to be used by a specific set of library routines,  it  is  best  to
declare them as global variables in the PCL source file:  

        integer screen_size             ! global variable

        command set-screen;
        begin
           external integer screen_size;
        ...
        end

3.4. Reserved names
  PCL  uses  a  number of reserved names which you may not use outside of their
normal context. For instance, you may not use them as variable names:  

ABORT                      INPUT                      SYNONYM
ALWAYS                     INRANGE                    THEN
BEGIN                      INTEGER                    TIME
BINARY                     INVISIBLE                  TO
CALL                       INVOKE                     TOPROGRAM
CASE                       KILLPROGRAM                TYPEIN
CLEARTYPEOUT               LEQ                        UNTIL
COMMAND                    LET                        WHILE
DATE                       LSS                        WILD
DCM                        NEQ                        WORDS
DEFAULT                    NOECHO
DEFAULT_DEV                NOHELP
DEFAULT_DIR                NOINDIRECT
DEFAULT_EXT                NOORIGINAL
DEFAULT_GEN                NOP
DEFAULT_NAM                NORETURN
DELETED                    OF
DISPLAY                    ORIGINAL
DO                         OTHERWISE
DOCOMMAND                  OUTPUT
ELSE                       PARSE
END                        PARSEONLY
EQL                        PASO
EXIT                       PASSOUTPUT
EXTERNAL                   PROCEDURE
FROM                       PROMPT
GEQ                        RADIX
GETTYPEOUT                 RETURN
GOTO                       SAVE
GTR                        SELECT
GUIDE                      SELECTALL
HELP                       STDHELP
IF                         STRING

3.5. String Manipulation
  Strings may be concatenated using simple addition statements.  

        conc_string = "Welcome " + name_in_full
        other_string = other_string + "appended text."

  Substrings may be extracted from strings:  

        extr_string = conc_string[n:m]

where  n  is the starting character number and m is the number of characters to
extract.  The leftmost character is character position 1.   The  user  may  use
                           th
[n:*] to extract from the n   character to the end of the string.

  The length of a string may be obtained using the $LENGTH system service.  

        count = $LENGTH(conc_string)

would  assign  the  length  of  the  string conc_string to the integer variable
count.

  A PCL routine may search for a substring of a string  by  using  the  $SEARCH
system service:  

        count = $SEARCH(conc_string,"SCOTT") 

would assign the starting location of the string SCOTT to count if it was found
in the string conc_string.  If no match is found $search returns 0.

3.6. Logical expressions
  Several PCL statements use logical expressions comparing integers or strings.
String  comparison  is based on the Ascii character sequence.  So that "ABC" is
less than "ABD" for instance.

  The syntax of a logical expression is:  

        operand1 logical-operator operand2 

  where:

operand1,operand2
                are both integer expressions or both string expressions

operator
is one of:

                   - LSS or <
                   - LEQ or <=
                   - EQL or =
                   - NEQ or <>
                   - GEQ or >=
                   - GTR or >

3.7. Procedures
  The format of a procedure definition in a source file is the same at that  of
a  command  definition  except  that the word COMMAND is replaced with the word
PROCEDURE.  A RETURN statement will return to the calling PCL routine.  

        PROCEDURE doit;
        Begin
         ...
        Return
        End

To use the procedure DOIT in a command it must be declared and then called.  

        COMMAND callit;
        Begin
         EXTERNAL PROCEDURE doit;
         ...
         CALL doit;
         ...
        End

  Parameters to procedures are declared by placing the list  of  parameters  in
parenthesis after the procedure name.  The parameters must be typed, i.e., they
must be specified as being either integers or strings.  

        PROCEDURE doit (INTEGER para_1,para_2;  STRING para_1);

  Procedures  may  have  a  type  and  thus  return  a  value.  To have a typed
procedure the word INTEGER or STRING  is  placed  in  front  of  the  PROCEDURE
keyword  in  the  source  file.    The value to be returned is placed after the
RETURN.  This may be any expression of the appropriate type.  

        INTEGER PROCEDURE upone (INTEGER in);
        RETURN in+1

  Procedures may modify their arguments (they are Input and Output formals):

        PROCEDURE CAT (string s1,s2,s3);
        s3 = s1 +s2;

3.8. PCL Flow Control
  PCL provides several ways to control the sequence of execution:

   - ABORT

   - EXIT

   - RETURN

   - DO, WHILE, UNTIL

   - IF ... THEN ... ELSE ...

   - CASE

   - SELECT

   - GOTO



3.8.1. ABORT
  Abort stops the execution of a PCL command and returns at Exec command  level
after printing an error message preceded by "?". See page 18.



3.8.2. EXIT
  Exit  stops  the execution of a PCL command without printing any message. see
page 29.



3.8.3. RETURN
  Return exits from the current PCL procedure and returns to its  caller.    If
used in a command RETURN acts as EXIT.



3.8.4. DO, WHILE, UNTIL
  DO,  WHILE,  and UNTIL are available for program loops.  These may be used in
the following combinations:

   1. DO PCL statement WHILE logical expression

   2. DO PCL statement UNTIL logical expression

   3. WHILE logical expression DO PCL statement

   4. UNTIL logical expression DO PCL statement

        ...
        i = 3;
        do begin
           display i;
           i = i - 1;
           end
        until
           i eql 0;



3.8.5. IF
  The IF statement will execute a PCL statement if the condition is true.    IF
may have an ELSE clause.  

        IF str_val = "xyz" THEN
            PCL statement
        ELSE
            PCL statement



3.8.6. CASE
  The  case statement provides a method of selectively executing PCL statements
depending on the value of an integer variable. The variable value is tested for
a match with specified constants. If a match is  found  the  corresponding  PCL
statement is executed:  

        CASE count FROM 1 to 10 of BEGIN
            1,2          : BEGIN ... END;
            3 TO 6, 10   : BEGIN ... END;
            5            : BEGIN ... END;
            INRANGE      : BEGIN ... END
            OUTRANGE     : BEGIN ... END
        END



3.8.7. SELECT
  The  SELECT  statement is similar to the CASE statement.  Instead of choosing
among a set of integer values  in  a  range,  SELECT  chooses  among  arbitrary
expressions.    The  expression  and  the test values must be of the same type,
either integer or string.

        SELECT str_var of BEGIN
                "abc"     : BEGIN ... END;
                "xyz"     : BEGIN ... END;
                OTHERWISE : Display "Not found"
                END

  In the above example.  If str_var contains the string abc then the statements
in the BEGIN-END pair after "abc": will be executed.  If str_var is neither abc
nor xyz then the OTHERWISE clause will  be  executed,  in  this  case  it  will
display 
        Not found

on  the  terminal  and  proceed  to  the  next  PCL  statement after the SELECT
statement.



3.8.8. SELECTALL
  The SelectAll statements is basically similar to Select,  except  that  after
executing one case it goes on to try to find more matches:  

        SELECTALL int_var of begin
            1,3       : display "1 or 3";
            2,4       : display "2 or 4";
            1 TO 2    : display "1 or 2";
            ALWAYS    : display "Always";
            OTHERWISE : display "Neither 1,2,3,4";
            end;

If  Int_var  is  2,  this  will  display  "2 or 4", then "1 or 2" and "always".
ALWAYS always gives a match, OTHERWISE matches only if no previous case matched
(for instance if int_var is 5).



3.8.9. GOTO
  The GOTO PCL statement causes an unconditional transfer to a label.  

        COMMAND xfer;
         BEGIN
         ...;
         loop1:
         ...;
         GOTO loop1;
         ...
        END



4. SYSTEM SERVICES
  Various system services are provided to return specific system information or
perform system functions.

4.1. System Constants
  PCL  provides  pre-defined constants that are useful in writing PCL routines,
or necessary to specify the arguments to some PCL system procedures.

$Append         INTEGER - An option to $OPEN for append mode.

$Cr             STRING - Contains just a carriage return.

$Crlf           STRING - Contains a carriage return and a line feed.

$Input          INTEGER - An option to $OPEN for input mode.

$Lf             STRING - A string containing a line feed.

$Parse          INTEGER  -  Specifies  the  file  currently  parsed   for   the
                $File_Dev,    $File_Dir,   $File_Dir,   $File_Nam,   $File_Typ,
                $File_Gen,  $Fileinfo_I,  $FileInfo_S   and   $FileSet   system
                procedures (see page 8).

$Quote          STRING - A string containing a double quote character.

  Other  constants  are provided by PCL specifically to ease the use of certain
system procedures: see pages 8, 8.

4.2. System Variables
  Some system procedures look like variables and may be used in most statements
where PCL allows to use a variable.  Some of these variables may be changed  by
the user (eg the prompts).

  The restrictions on the use of system variables are:

   - they may not be used as the arguments to PARSE options:

        PARSE (KEYWORD (WORDS(...),
                        DEFAULT $ConnectedDirectory ));

                is wrong and must be replaced by

        mydir = $ConnectedDirectory;
        PARSE (KEYWORD (WORDS(...),
                        DEFAULT mydir));

   - a string system variable may not be used as argument to $Strloc.

  Most of these restrictions are NOT detected when you declare a PCL statement,
but their violation leads to wrong behaviour when executing the command.

  The system service variables are:

$Ac1, $Ac2, $Ac3, $ac4
                INTEGER - Contain the first four register values after the last
                $Jsys executed.

$Account        STRING - The account of the current job.

$ARPAnet_Node   STRING - The system's ARPAnet node name.  This is a null string
                if the system is not on the ARPAnet.

$Atom           STRING  -  After  a PARSE statement, contains the text typed in
                for most parse types (all but Noise, EOL, Comma, and Token.)

$Batch_Job      INTEGER - Non-zero if the job is a batch job.

$Command        STRING - Contains the complete text of the last command parsed,
                or of the current command up to the last field  parsed  with  a
                PARSE PCL statement.

$ConnectedDirectory
                STRING - The name of the currently connected directory

$Curtad         INTEGER  - The current date and time in system internal format.
                (Date and Time: Tops 20 stores dates and time internally  in  a
                single  integer with in the left half the day counted since the
                18th of November 1858, and in the right half  the  fraction  of
                the  day  elapsed since midnight. The fraction is the numerator
                of a fraction that has a denominator of 2**18. When entering  a
                date and time into Tops 20, all usual formats are valid: 3-DEC-
                83,  03/DEC/83,  08:51, 16:50, 4:50PM, etc. The system routines
                $Curtad, $Date, $InputTad, $OutputTad, $ExpandTad and $MergeTad
                deal with dates and times.  )

$Date           STRING - Current date in DD-MON-YY format

$DECnet_Node    STRING - The system's DECnet node name.  This is a null  string
                if the system is not on a DECnet.

$Directory      STRING  -  After executing a parse of Directory(ies) with PARSE
                DIRECTORY or DIRECTORYLIST, contains the name  of  the  current
                directory  parsed, including the angle brackets ("<...>"). (see
                page 10).

$EMACSTerminal  INTEGER  -  Returns  a  1  if  the  current  terminal  can   be
                "effectively"  used  by  EMACS,  0  if not.  [CMU and sites who
                customize PCL only].

$FileL          STRING - After executing a PARSE FILE statement or some similar
                PARSE (INPUTFILE, OUTPUTFILE, FILELIST), this contains the file
                name       entered       in       the       longest       form,
                DEV:<DIRECTORY>FILE.EXT.VERSION

$FileN          STRING  -  After parsing a filename this contains the file name
                entered in the normal form, FILE.EXT.VERSION

$FileS          STRING - After parsing a filename this contains the  file  name
                entered  in  the  form  FILE.EXT.  It  will contain device: and
                <directory> if they are different from the connected device and
                directory.

$FileV          INTEGER - After parsing a filename this contains contains  just
                the generation number as an integer variable

                the usual "@" is not suitable:  

        $PromptReg = "Tops20>";

$PromptSub      STRING  -  The  standard  subcommand prompt string, may also be
                changed.

                on the controlling terminal.

$User           STRING - After parsing a user name with PARSE USER or  USERLIST
                this  contains  the  current  User  Name parsed, (without angle

$UserName       STRING - The user name of the current job

$Value          INTEGER - Contains a number returned by  a  Parse:  The  number
                typed in for a Number field, the value for a Keyword or Switch,
                or the internal date and time for a DayTime.

$Xatom          STRING  - Contains the atom parsed by the last PARSE statement.
                Note that when parsing a Filelist, DirectoryList  or  UserList,
                this  does  not  contain the whole field but only the last atom
                actually parsed by the Comnd JSYS.

4.3. System Procedures
  PCL provides pre-defined procedures.  Some are typed procedures and therefore
may be used like variables in PCL statements.  Others return their  results  in
parameters.  In the following list of system procedures, if a procedure returns
a  value then STRING or INTEGER precedes the description, otherwise we indicate
PROCEDURE.  A simple procedure that does not return a value must be called:  

        CH = $OPEN ("TEST.DAT", $INPUT);
        ...
        CALL $CLOSE (CH);

$And (int1, int2)
                INTEGER - Returns the bitwise AND  of  the  integers  int1  and
                int2.

$Close (channel)
                PROCEDURE - Closes the file that is open on Channel.

$CvItC (integer)
                STRING  -  Returns  the  character  whose  value  is  equal the
                Integer.  This is useful for manipulating control characters.

$CvCtI (string) INTEGER - Converts  the  first  character  in  String  into  an
                integer.  This is useful for control character manipulation.

$DirectoryInfo_I (directory, code)
                INTEGER -

$DirectoryInfo_S (directory, code)
                  STRING - $DirectoryInfo_I and $DirectoryInfo_S return integer
                or string information that may be obtained using the  GTDIR  or
                GTDAL  JSYS's  (refer  to  the  Tops 20 Monitor Calls Reference
                Manual for more  details).  Directory  is  the  directory  name
                (string).    The  CRDIR directory block layout is reproduced in
                appendix II.

                $DirectoryInfo_I returns an integer. It  admits  the  following
                values for Code:

                $CDDFE          default  off-line expunge date and time (-- not
                                yet implemented in tops20 v5 --)
                $CDDNE          -- not yet implemented in tops20 v5 --
                $CDDPT          directory protection
                $CDFPT          default file protection
                $CDLEN          default on-line expiration  date  (--  not  yet
                                implemented in Tops 20 V5 --)
                $CDLIQ          working disk quota
                $CDLLD          date last login
                $CDLOQ          permanent disk quota
                $CDMOD          directory mode word
                $CDNUM          directory number
                $CDPRV          capabilities word
                $CDRET          default number of generations to keep
                $CDSDQ          maximum number of subdirectories
                $CDUSD          Disk space used (as returned by the GTDAL Jsys,
                                and usually not correct under Tops20 V5).

                $DirectoryInfo_S  returns  a  string.  It  admits the following
                values of Code:

                $CDCUG          subdirectory groups
                $CDDAC          default account string
                $CDDGP          directory groups
                $CDPSW          password string
                $CDUGP          user groups

                The user/directory  groups  and  the  subdirectory  groups  are
                returned  as  a  string with all the group numbers separated by
                commas.  For example:  

           ! User groups
        display $directoryinfo_s ("<DOE>", $CDUGP);
           ! Default account
        display $directoryinfo_s ("<DOE>", $CDDAC);
           ! Protection
        display $string ( $Directoryinfo_I("<DOE>", $CDDPT), 8);

                Presently there is no $DirectorySet function in PCL.

$Eof (channel)  INTEGER - Set to -1 if a  $READ  reaches  an  end  of  file  on
                Channel, otherwise returns 0.

$ExpandTad (idate, year, month, day of month, day of week, hour, minute)
                PROCEDURE  - Converts the date and time held in internal format
                in Idate into 6 integers representing the year, month,  day  of
                month,  day  of week, hour and minute.  The converse is done by
                $MERGETAD.

$File_Dev (fil) STRING

$File_Dir (fil) STRING

$File_Nam (fil) STRING

$File_Typ (fil) STRING

$File_Gen (fil) STRING - $File_Dev through $File_Gen return  the  part  of  the
                file name of Fil expressing respectively the Device, Directory,
                Name,  Type  and  Generation.    Fil may be either $parse, or a
                channel number, or a file name (see $FileInfo_S 8).

$FileInfo_I (fil, code)
                INTEGER

$FileInfo_S (fil, code [,format])
                 STRING - $FileInfo_I and $FileInfo_S return information  about
                a  file.  The  file  is  selected by Fil and the information to
                return is selected by Code.

                Fil may be:

                $Parse          the file currently being parsed by a PARSE FILE
                                or PARSE FILELIST,

                a channel number
                                for a file currently opened by a call to $open,

                a filename      The filename is given  as  a  string.  If  some
                                parts of the file name are omitted they default
                                to  the  connected  device  and directory, null
                                file type, and highest existing generation. The
                                name itself may not be defaulted.

                $FileInfo_I  returns  an  integer  from  the  file  FDB   (File
                Descriptor  Block).    For $FileInfo_I code is the index of the
                word requested in the FDB (File Descriptor  Block).    See  the
                Tops20  Monitor Calls Reference Manual for details.  Appendix I
                gives the layout of the FDB.  PCL constants  are  provided  for
                all permissible codes:

                $FBADR          disk address of file index block
                $FileAddress       idem

                $FileWrite         idem 

                $FileInfo_S returns a string from information pointed to by the
                FDB,  or  the  result  of  a  JFNS  Jsys  call,  with  specific
                formatting  bits  given by Format (Refer to the Tops 20 Monitor
                Call Reference Manual for details):  The  values  of  Code  for
                $FileInfo_S   are   either   FDB  offsets,  or  special  values
                requesting a specific function):

                $Author            idem 
                $FBFMT          specifies  that  $FileInfo_s  must  return  the
                                result  of  a  JFNS Jsys, using the format bits
                                specified in Format.  (An  obsolete  format  of
                                $FileInfo_S  specified  that  if  code  was  an
                                integer greater than  63  the  result  was  the
                                string   returned  by  a  JFNS  Jsys  with  the
                                formatting parameter  set  to  the  field  code
                                minus 64.)

                $FileSet  allows  to change the information read by $FileInfo_I
                and $FileInfo_S.

$FileSet (fil, code, mask, value)
                PROCEDURE - $FileSet allows to set the information contained in
                the FDB (for a complete  explanation  of  the  File  Descriptor
                Block,  refer  to  the  Tops20 Monitor Calls Reference Manual).
                Presently, features relating to the Archiving  system  are  not
                implemented.

                Fil is selected as for $FileInfo: $Parse, or channel number, or
                filename (see page 8).

                Code  defines  which  entry  of  the  FDB  we  want  to change.
                Permissible values are the same as for $FileInfo (see page  8).
                It  is  the FDB offset of the entry that we want to modify (see
                the list of codes page 8, and appendix I for a  description  of
                the  FDB).    If  the  entry  is  a  pointer  to  a string, the
                information to  be  changed  is  the  string  itself,  not  the
                pointer.

                Mask is an integer indicating the bit positions that we want to
                change. It must contain ones in all positions to be changed. If
                the  information  to  be  changed is a string, this argument is
                ignored.

                Value is either an  integer  or  a  string,  depending  on  the
                information to be changed.

                For example:  

           ! Change account
        call $FileSet ($parse, $FBACT, -1, "OVERHEAD");
           ! Zero Read count of File
        call $FileSet ("test.pcl", $FBCNT, 8%777777, 0);

                $FileInfo_I  and  $FileInfo_S  read the information that may be
                changed with $FileSet.

                    Several fields of the FDB may not be changed,  or  only
                    with certain capabilities.

                    The information in the FDB that is modified by the ARCF
                    and  SFTAD  Jsys's  is  not  currently  changeable with
                    $FileSet.  

$GetField (ival, pos, wid)
                INTEGER - Returns the Wid bits found at bit positions Pos+1  to
                Pos+Wid  in  ival  (numbered  0..35 from right to left), stored
                right  justified  in  an  integer and filled with zeroes to the
                left.  For example, $Getfield(ival,18,18) returns the left half
                of ival.  Ival, Pos and Wid are integers.   See  $SetField  for
                the reverse operation.

$InputTad (string)
                INTEGER - Converts a string time and date into internal format.
                The converse is done by $OutputTad.

$Integer (string [,radix])
                INTEGER  -  Converts  decimal number in string into an integer.
                An optional second argument (integer) gives  the  radix  to  be
                used (2 to 10).  Returns 0 on an error.

$IsFile (fil)   INTEGER  -  Returns  1  if  the  file  specified by Fil exists,
                otherwise returns 0.    Fil  is  specified  as  for  $FileInfo:
                $Parse, or a channel number, or the file name.

$Length (string)
                INTEGER - Returns the length of string

$MergeTad (year,month,day of month,hour,minute)
                INTEGER  -  Returns  the  conversion  to internal date and time
                format of the date expressed by the five integers Year,  Month,
                Day  of  month,  Hour,  Minutes.    The  converse  is  done  by
                $ExpandTad.

$NextDirectory  INTEGER - Used to step to the next  directory  when  parsing  a
                DirectoryList or Directory with Wild turned on. Returns zero at
                the end of the list, and nonzero otherwise. (see page 10).

$NextFile       INTEGER - Used to step to the next file when parsing a FileList
                or  File  with  Wild turned on.  Returns zero at the end of the
                list, and nonzero otherwise.

$NextUser       INTEGER - Used to step to the next User when parsing a UserList
                or UserName with Wild turned on. Returns zero at the end of the
                list, and nonzero otherwise. (see page 10).

$Open (string, mode)
                INTEGER - Opens the file named in the string for  I/O,  in  the
                mode  specified by the integer mode (either $Input, $Output, or
                $Append).  Returns the PCL channel number assigned, or zero  if
                the open could not be done.

$Or (int1,int2) INTEGER - Returns the bitwise OR of the integers int1 and int2.

$OutputTad (integer)
                STRING  -  Convert  internal  date  and  time  to  string.  The
                converse is done by $InputTad.

$Read (channel) STRING - Reads a record from  the  file  opened  for  input  on
                Channel.

$ReadBinary (max, string [,timeout])
                STRING  -  Reads  from  the  terminal,  in  binary,  up  to Max
                characters or until the character specified in String is  read.
                This  will  time  out  and return an empty string if nothing is
                typed within a second.  The optional integer  argument  Timeout
                can  be  used  to provide the number of milliseconds to use for
                the timeout  period.    This  is  useful  for  reading  control
                information  transmitted  by  the VT100 terminal in response to
                requests such as "send terminal  model  ID"  and  "send  cursor
                position."

$Search (string1, string2 [,start])
                INTEGER  -  Searches  the  String1  for String2 and returns the
                position in  String1  of  the  first  character  of  the  first
                occurence  of  String2.  If not found, returns 0.  The optional
                integer argument Start gives the character  position  at  which
                the search starts.

$SearchRaised (string1, string2 [,integer])
                INTEGER  -  Same  as  $SEARCH except lower case alphabetics are
                raised to upper case.

$SetField (field, word, pos, wid)
                INTEGER - Returns the integer Word with the rightmost Wid  bits
                of Field stored in the bit positions Pos+1 to Pos+wid (numbered
                0..35 from right to left). For example:  

        I = $SETFIELD(123,8%777777777777,3,9)

        returns 777777771237 (displayed in octal)

$String (integer [,radix])
                STRING  -  Converts  the  integer  into  a  string.    Radix is
                optional. It gives the radix to be used (2 to 10).  If  omitted
                the  integer  is  expressed  in decimal.  If the radix is other
                than 10, the number is output as unsigned:  

        display $String(-1)       displays -1
        display $String(-1,8)     displays 777777777777

$Wait (integer) PROCEDURE - Waits the  specified  number  of  milliseconds,  or
                forever if zero.

$Write (channel,record)
                PROCEDURE  -  Writes  the  string  Record  into the output file
                opened on Channel.

4.4. System Procedures specific to $Jsys Interface, memory management
  A JSYS interface is provided in PCL extended. It gives facilities to set/read
the registers, set/read argument blocks. The routines in this section should be
considered provisional; there will be  changes  for  instance  if  vectors  are
implemented.

$Get_Mem (size) INTEGER - Acquires Size words from dynamic memory (actually PCL
                string  space), and returns the address of the first word. When
                referencing dynamic memory with $Iget, $Iput, $Sget  and  $Sput
                the  first  word has index zero, not one.  The memory is zeroed
                before you get it.

$Ret_mem (address, size)
                PROCEDURE - Frees the memory at Address.  Size  should  be  the
                same  as  given  when  the  memory  was  acquired by "address =
                $get_mem (size)".

$Iput (value, address [,index [,count]])
                PROCEDURE - Sets count words starting at Address+Index  to  the
                integer Value. This is used to store integers in dynamic memory
                acquired  through  $Get_Mem.  Index starts at 0 and defaults to
                0. Count defaults to 1.

$Iget (address, [,index])
                INTEGER - Returns the value stored at Address+Index.  Index  is
                expressed with zero base, and defaults to 0.

$Sput (string, address [,index [,charpos]])
                PROCEDURE  -  Stores the asciz String starting at the character
                in char position Charpos  (counted  from  0)  in  the  word  at
                Address+Index  (Note that Index starts at zero). If Charpos, or
                both Charpos and Index, are omitted, they default to zero.

$Sget (address, [,index[,charpos]])
                STRING - Returns the asciz string starting at the character  in
                position   Charpos   (counted   from   zero)  in  the  word  at
                Address+Index. If  Charpos,  or  both  Charpos  and  Index  are
                omitted, they default to zero.

$Jfn (channel)  INTEGER  - If Channel is > 0 and a file is currently associated
                with that channel ( see page 13),  return  the  jfn  associated
                with it.

                If  Channel  is < 0 return the Indexable File Handle associated
                with the current parse: if the PARSE used the WILD  option  the
                flag  bits  are  returned  in the left half, and the jfn in the
                right half, otherwise only the JFN is returned.

$Jsys (jsys [,ac1 [,ac2 [,ac3[,ac4]]]])
                INTEGER - Executes the jsys number Jsys with  the  contents  of
                the  registers  defined  by  the optional arguments Ac1 through
                Ac4. Returns 1 for success, and 0 for  failure.    The  success
                indicator is also stored in the system variable $Jsysok.  After
                execution,  the  registers 1 through 4 are stored in the system
                variables $Ac1 through $ac4.

$Jsys1 (jsys [,ac1 [,ac2 [,ac3[,ac4]]]])
                PROCEDURE - Totally similar to $Jsys, except does not return  a
                value.

$Strloc (string)
                INTEGER - Returns the actual memory address of a string primary
                (ie  a  string  constant or a string variable). This may not be
                used with string expressions or  with  strings  returned  by  a
                system procedure:  

        mydir = $connectedDirectory;
        i = $strloc (mydir);                    ! Is Legal

        i = $strloc ($ConnectedDirectory);      ! Is Wrong



5. USER INTERFACE
  Parameters  are  often passed to commands from the terminal, just like normal
Exec commands.  PCL allows the user to specify such parameter parsing using the
same monitor call as the Exec uses, so the user is able to write commands which
look like standard Exec commands.

  When creating commands, it is easiest first to parse all the  parameters  and
to  store  them  in appropriate variables, then to parse the end of the line to
allow the user to confirm the command, and only then  to  perform  the  actions
which  comprise  the  command.   It is possible, using the COMND% JSYS, to make
programs which parse a few arguments, do  some  irreversible  action  (such  as
deleting  a  file),  and  then  parse a few more arguments; such programs upset
users who, for instance, type ^U while entering those  last  parameters,  since
the program has already deleted the file.  PCL enforces and encourages the more
desirable mode of operation, in part by performing an assumed End-of-line Parse
before performing major actions such as DoCommand.

  Command parsing is done a line at a time, where the user types a line and the
program parses it.  This means that once a line has been confirmed with an End-
of-line  Parse,  no  more  fields can be parsed with the Parse statement, since
there is no command line to parse from.  The Prompt statement can  be  used  to
allow the user to enter another line to be parsed; see Prompt on page 47.

  If  a  PCL command contains none of the three forms of command parsing, it is
built as if it started off with an End-of-line Parse.

  The Complete description of the PARSE statement is given page 42.

5.1. Parse Formats
  There are three ways to cause PCL to parse such parameters; in each case  the
user  specifies  what type of parameter is expected, and PCL parses it from the
command line and delivers it to the PCL command.



5.1.1. Simple PARSE
  The simple PARSE statement may be placed anywhere within the command.  

        COMMAND getarg;
        BEGIN
        INTEGER repeat_count;
         ...;
        PARSE NUMBER;
        repeat_count = $VALUE;
         ...;
        PARSE EOL;
         ...
        END

would parse for a number, store it in a variable for use, execute some more PCL
statements, and then parse for a carriage return.  The  PARSE  statement  would
store the value that the user entered in the system variable $VALUE.



5.1.2. Complex PARSE
  The complex parse provides a way for one PARSE statement to parse for any one
of  several parse types.  The syntax of this form of PARSE looks very much like
the SELECT verb.  

        COMMAND CMPLX;
        BEGIN
         ...;
        PARSE
            BEGIN
            NUMBER: BEGIN ... END;
            EOL   : BEGIN ... END
            END;
         ...
        END

This would allow the user to enter either a number or a  carriage  return;  the
corresponding  statements (enclosed in BEGIN - END) would be executed depending
on which field type matched the user's input.  In either case more  information
would be available from variables like $VALUE.



5.1.3. Command Arguments
  An easy way to specify the arguments is to use command arguments.  These must
be specified in the command declaration (the statement with the keyword COMMAND
and  the  name of the command).  The user specifies the type of parameter to be
parsed and the variable to store the result into (see  page  24  for  details).
The  variable  must  not  be  declared  later; the use in the command arguments
completely declares the variable.  

        COMMAND AllAtOnce (NUMBER:count);
        BEGIN
        !No INTEGER declaration necessary
        DISPLAY $STRING(count)
        END

5.2. Parse Options
  In each of these 3 methods, the user may specify options to the  parse  type.
Parse  options  are  enclosed  in parentheses immediately after the parse type.
There are many options that the user can specify, e.g.  the  default  value  to
use  if  the  user  skips  this parameter or a help message to type if the user
enters a question mark at the parameter.  The parse options available vary with
the parse type.  

        COMMAND optn
        BEGIN
        ...;
        PARSE NUMBER (Help "Value of count", Default "2");
                |       |                       |
                |       ----> Parse options <----
                --> Field type
        ...
        END

If the user DECLARES this command and then types:  

        @optn ?

at the "@" prompt, the system will respond:  

        Value of count

as it would in any EXEC command.  If the user skips the field by typing:  

        @optn<return>

at the "@" prompt or if the user uses ESCAPE to complete the command  then  the
PARSE will return the default value, in this case 2.

5.3. Parse Results
  The results of each Parse are returned by PCL in several system variables:

$Xatom          returns  exactly  the  Atom  parsed  (i.e. what the user typed,
                eventually completed by the user hitting the ESCape key).  This
                field  is  not correct for the parsing of field types FileList,
                DirectoryList and Userlist.

$Command        holds the text of the complete command up to the point  reached
                in the current parse.

$Value          returns  an  integer  result  if  necessary,  for example after
                parsing a number or a keyword (see page 42).

$Atom           returns a string result if necessary, for example after parsing
                a token (see page 42).

5.4. FILELIST
  One powerful extension to PARSE is the FILELIST option.  This allows the user
to parse for file names which may contain wild cards, be separated  by  commas,
or  both.   The name of the first file which matches the specification that the
user entered is returned  in  the  system  variables  $FileL,  $FileN,  $FileS,
$FileV.    Successive  file names may be returned by using the $NEXTFILE system
service procedure: $NextFile returns zero when  the  list  of  files  has  been
exhausted, and returns nonzero otherwise.  

        COMMAND ALLFILES;
        BEGIN
        GUIDE "Files";
        PARSE FILELIST;
        DO
           DISPLAY $FILEL
           UNTIL $NEXTFILE EQL 0;
        END

  The user may type:  

        @allfiles ABC.*,XYZ%Y.*,A.Z

The  first  file that matches the specification of ABC.* will be returned.  For
each call to $NEXTFILE the system will return file names that  match  the  wild
cards  until all that match ABC.* have been exhausted .  Next, it will look for
files that match XYZ%Y.*.  Finally, it will return the file name A.Z.

  FILELIST may only be specified once per command and  it  may  only  be  in  a
simple parse.

  Note  that  the  same  effect  may  be achieved by using the WILD option when
parsing a FILE field type, with the restriction  that  only  one  specification
(containing  wildcards)  may  be  given. In the above example, "PARSE FILELIST"
would be replaced by "PARSE (FILE (WILD))".

5.5. DIRECTORYLIST, USERLIST
  DIRECTORYLIST  and  USERLIST  are  extensions  allowing  to  parse  lists  of
Directories  of lists of Users (login directories), using wildcard input in the
way of FILELIST. The successive  Directories  or  Users  are  returned  in  the
variables  $DIRECTORY and $USER .  Successive directories or users are returned
by using the $NEXTDIRECTORY or $NEXTUSER integer system  procedures.  When  the
list has been exhausted these return 0, otherwise they return nonzero.

        COMMAND ALLUSERS;
        BEGIN

        PARSE USERLIST;

        DO
           DISPLAY $USER
           UNTIL $NEXTUSER EQL 0;

        END;

  The user might type in:  
        @allusers info.1lic.*,info.2lic.*

        or

        @alldirectories <info.1lic.*>,<info.2lic.*>

  Directory  names  must be given with the "<...>" (angle brackets), while user
names may not include them.

  Only one of either DirectoryList or UserList may be  specified  per  command,
and it must be in a simple parse.

  Note also that a similar effect may be achieved by using the wild option when
parsing  a field of type DIRECTORY or USERNAME. However, in this case, only one
specification with wildcards may be entered:

        COMMAND ALLDIRECTORIES;
        BEGIN

        PARSE (DIRECTORY (WILD));
        DO
           DISPLAY $DIRECTORY;
           UNTIL $NEXTDIRECTORY EQL 0;
        END;

5.6. Parse error handling
  Errors found during parsing are handled differently depending on  which  type
of  parse  was executed.  In command arguments, the user can specify a label to
branch to by using the ERROR parse option.  This is only available for  command
arguments.   The command will begin execution at that label if the user entered
something which was not legal for the specified parse type.  

        COMMAND oops (NUMBER(ERROR notnum) : count)
         ...;
        notnum:
         ...

  In simple parsing, the command is terminated and the standard  error  message
for that parse type is displayed at the terminal.  In complex parsing, the user
may have an OTHERWISE parse option which will be executed if the parse fails.  

        COMMAND CMPLX;
        BEGIN
         ...
        PARSE BEGIN
           NUMBER:     BEGIN ... END;
           EOL:        BEGIN ... END;
           OTHERWISE:  BEGIN
              Display "Error in parameter";
              Exit
              END
           END;
         ...
        END



6. PROGRAM AND COMMAND INTERFACE

6.1. Running Programs
  The  INVOKE  PCL statement runs a program much like the EXEC run command does
now.  The PCL command continues to execute when the program has  started.    If
the  PCL  routine  exits,  the  program  is left in a ^C state.  INVOKE takes a
string argument which contains the name of the program to run.  The TYPEIN  PCL
statement  "types" characters into the program.  When a TYPEIN is executed, the
PCL command will wait until the program goes into terminal input wait.  It will
then send the characters to the program and continue to execute PCL statements.
The GETTYPEOUT statement is used to return the data that the program would have
typed on the terminal, placing it  in  the  string  that  the  user  specifies.
GETTYPEOUT  will  get  all  characters  since  the  INVOKE  or  since  the last
GETTYPEOUT.  The PASSOUTPUT option to the INVOKE statement causes  all  of  the
data  from  the  program  to  go to the controlling terminal.  The CLEARTYPEOUT
command will throw away all the program type out that has  accumulated.    This
may  be  used  in place of a GETTYPEOUT to get rid of unwanted startup messages
from programs.  

        COMMAND prog;
        BEGIN
         STRING prog_data;
          ...;
         INVOKE "payrol.exe";
         CLEARTYPEOUT;
         TYPEIN $DATE;      $DATE is a system service
         GETTYPEOUT prog_data;
         DISPLAY prog_data;
          ...
        END

6.2. Executing EXEC Commands
  The DOCOMMAND PCL statement takes a string argument  and  performs  the  EXEC
command that is in the string.  

        COMMAND whome;
        DOCOMMAND "systat " + $UserName;

After typing whome at the "@" prompt the user would see:  

         Job  Line Program  User
          30*   44  SYSTAT  JS5A

at  the  terminal.    The  output from the command is displayed on the terminal
unless the optional TO parameter is specified.  In this case the type out  from
the command is placed in a string specified by the user:  

        DOCOMMAND "systat all" TO exec_string

  To execute a command and ignore the output, do:

        DOCOMMAND command TO $NUL;



7. INPUT/OUTPUT
  PCL  provides  simple  file  manipulation  facilities.  Up to 36 files may be
opened in input, output, or append mode.  Only record level  reads  and  writes
are possible.  A record is terminated by a carriage return/line feed pair.  The
$OPEN  system service takes the name of the file and whether it is to be opened
for input, output, or append access.  $OPEN returns the PCL channel  number  to
be  associated  with  the file.  If the file does not exist and you open it for
Input, $open returns 0 for the channel  number;  otherwise  the  channel  is  a
positive integer.  

        channel = $OPEN("mail.txt",$INPUT)

  The string procedure $READ takes a channel number as argument and returns the
next  record  in the file.  $WRITE takes a channel number as the first argument
and a string as the second argument, and writes the string to the file.  

        In_record = $READ(channel1);
        Call $WRITE(channel2,in_record);

  The user may test for end of file by calling the $EOF system procedure.  If a
$READ reaches the end of file, then $EOF will return -1, otherwise  it  returns
zero.  $EOF takes the channel number of the file as an argument.

  Files may be closed with the $CLOSE call.  $CLOSE takes the channel number of
the  file  to  close. It may not be necessary to close files open for input, as
they will be closed automatically at the end of the PCL command.



8. REFERENCE
                                  EXPRESSIONS




8.1. EXPRESSIONS
  Expressions  are  the fundamental arithmetic, string, and logical entities of
the PCL language.



8.1.1. Integer expressions
  Integer expressions are composed of integer constants, integer variables, and
integer procedure calls, operated on by arithmetic  operators.    PCL  has  the
usual  operators  for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with
the usual precedence rules, and allowing the use of parentheses to add  to  the
default precedence.

        count*(shift+1) + offset(commandstring)



8.1.2. String expressions
  String   expressions  and  likewise  composed  of  string  variables,  string
constants, and string procedure calls, operated on by operators.    The  string
operators  are  concatenation  (indicated  by  the  "+"  symbol)  and substring
extraction (indicated by square brackets).  Concatenation takes two strings and
generates a new string from them.  Substring extraction looks like

        substring = str[start:count]

where start is the location of the first character to extract, and count is the
number of characters to extract.  An asterisk can be  used  for  the  count  to
extract to the end of the string.



8.1.3. Logical expressions
  Logical  expressions  are  only used to control conditional statements; there
are no logical  variables.    Logical  expressions  are  generated  from  typed
variables,  constants,  or procedure calls (either integer or string), compared
with  relational  operators:    "<",  "<=",  "=",  "<>",  ">=",  and  ">".  The
relationals   "lss",   "leq",  "eql",  "neq",  "geq"  and  "gtr"  may  be  used
alternatively.

        if my_dir eql $connectedDirectory
           ...
        if count <= 20
           ...

                                  STATEMENTS




8.2. STATEMENTS
  Statements  are the fundamental execution entities of the PCL language.  They
may be grouped together to form a compound statement, by enclosing  them  in  a
BEGIN/END  pair,  and  separating  them  by  semicolons.    Anywhere  that  the
documentation for a statement says that a statement may  be  used,  a  compound
statement may be used just as well.

        IF i EQL 0
        THEN
            BEGIN
            j=6;
            k=10
            END
        ELSE
            j=0

  Braces may be substituted for BEGIN ... END:

        if i eql 0 then {
            begin
            j=6;
            k=10
            }
        else
            j=0

                                   PCL FILES




8.3. PCL files
  A  PCL file contains PCL declarations for commands, procedures and variables,
as well as PCL statements like NOORIGINAL and SYNONYM.  PCL files are  compiled
using the Exec DECLARE PCL-ROUTINES command.

  The structure of a PCL file is:

        declaration [; declaration ...]

        where:

        declaration is:
                command-declaration     or
                procedure-declaration   or
                variable-declaration    or
                NOORIGINAL command      or
                SYNONYM command

  A  command  declaration declares a PCL command. It is described in 8.10, page
24. Within a command declaration, we find declarations of local  variables  and
the code to execute the command.

  A  procedure  declaration  declares  a  PCL  procedure  for  use by other PCL
commands and procedures (see page 46).  Its contents are similar to those of  a
command.

  A  variable  declaration  declares  global  PCL variables, either integers or
strings. These variables will be available to all PCL commands and  procedures,
with the EXTERNAL declaration.

  The NOORIGINAL command removes an original Exec command (see page 40).

  The SYNONYM command declares a synonym to an existing command (see page 52).

                                     ABORT




8.4. ABORT
  Function
  The  ABORT  PCL  statement  will  abort a PCL execution with an error message
typed to the user.
  Format

        ABORT string

  Notes

   1. The string error message will be typed on the terminal, preceded  by
      "?".

  Example

        COMMAND ohdear;
         BEGIN
          ...;
          IF $LENGTH(input_line)  > 120 then ABORT "Line too long";
         ...
        END

                                  ASSIGNMENT




8.5. ASSIGNMENT
  Function
  The assignment statement generates a value and deposits it in a variable.
  Format

        variable name = expression

  Notes

   1. The  expression  must  be either integer or string, depending on the
      type of the variable.

  Example

        COMMAND look;
        BEGIN
        ...;
        target_user = $Atom;
        ...
        END

        Expressions - page 15
                                  BEGIN - END




8.6. BEGIN - END
  Function
  BEGIN  is  paired  with  an  END  to  group  several  PCL statements into one
statement.
  Format

        BEGIN
           PCL statement;
           ...
           END

        or

        { PCL statement;
           ...
           }

  Notes

   1. Every BEGIN must have a corresponding END.

   2. A BEGIN/END pair may enclose any number of PCL statements.  Anywhere
      a  PCL  statement  is  called  for,  a  BEGIN/END  grouping  may  be
      substituted.

   3. It  is  not  necessary  to  have a semicolon following the final PCL
      statement before the END.  If present, a null  statement  is  formed
      which will not affect the execution of the PCL command.

   4. Begin...End may be replaced by {...}.

  Example

        If $JOBNO > 6 then BEGIN
                               Display "Job number greater than 6";
                               A = 5;
                               name = "Scott";
                          END

  Related
                                     CALL




8.7. CALL
  Function
  The CALL PCL statement will call a previously declared procedure.
  Format

        CALL procedure [ (arguments) ]

        arguments is:
           parameter1 [ ,parameter2... ]

        parameter is:
           integer-expression  or
           string expression


  Notes

   1. CALL may call system procedures or user declared procedures.

   2. If  the  procedure  expects  arguments  they must be provided in the
      call.

   3. Note that typed procedures are not exactly referenced using the same
      form without the call.

   4. Arguments are expressions, either integer or string as  expected  by
      the  called  procedure.  Those arguments which are to be modified by
      the procedure must be simple variables.

   5. Parameters are always passed by reference; all accesses made by  the
      called procedure are actually made to the caller's variables.

  Example

        COMMAND a_rtn;
         BEGIN
          EXTERNAL PROCEDURE match;
          EXTERNAL INTEGER PROCEDURE drop;
          ...
          IF drop ("abc") eql 1 then
             CALL match ("abc");
          ...
         END

                                     CASE




8.8. CASE
  Function
  The  CASE  statement provides an orderly way of choosing one of several paths
to take based on the current value of an integer  expression.    The  statement
tagged with the current value is executed, and all others are ignored.
  Format

        CASE integer_expression FROM low TO high OF BEGIN
           test : PCL-statement;
           test : PCL-statement;
           ...
           END;

        low, high are:
           integer constants

        test is:
           tag1 [ ,tag2 ... ]

        tag is:
           constant   or
           constant1 TO constant2   or
           INRANGE   or
           OUTRANGE

  Notes

   1. The  integer  expression  is  tested  against  each test for a match
      against any of the tags expressed in it. When a match is found,  the
      statement  corresponding  to  the test is executed.  The FROM and TO
      keywords  precede  integers  defining   the   lowest   and   highest
      permissible  value  of the expression.  If the expression is outside
      the limits and an OUTRANGE tag was specified, the statement labelled
      by the OUTRANGE tag is executed.  If the expression is  outside  the
      limits and no OUTRANGE tag was specified, PCL issues an error.

   2. After  a  sucessful  match, and execution of the corresponding code,
      execution proceeds after the CASE.

   3. The INRANGE keyword indicates that the tagged  statement  is  to  be
      executed  if the integer expression is within the range allowed, but
      is not explicitly provided for by any of the other integer  constant
      tags.  The INRANGE tag must be the last in the list.

   4. If the integer expression is within the FROM-TO limits, but there is
      no  statement  tagged  with that value, and there is no INRANGE tag,
      then nothing is done and  execution  continues  with  the  statement
      following the CASE.

   5. The  CASE  statement should be used when the values to be tested are
      very thightly packed (eg most numbers between 1 and 10).  It  should
      never  be  used  to  test on a wide range like 1,2,100 (Use a Select
      Instead).

   6. The CASE tests against integer constants. For testing agains  values
      that  are  known  only when executing the command or against strings
      use SELECT or SELECTALL.

  Example

        ...
        CASE $Value FROM 1 to 7 OF BEGIN
           1 TO 3, 5 : {executed if $value
                             is between 1 and 3, or 5};
           6,9       : {executed if $value is 6 or 9};
           INRANGE   : {executed if $value is 4, 7, 8 or 10}
           END;

                                 CLEARTYPEOUT




8.9. CLEARTYPEOUT
  Function
  The  CLEARTYPEOUT  PCL  statement  will  discard the output typed out from an
INVOKED program.
  Format

        CLEARTYPEOUT

  Notes

   1. The CLEARTYPEOUT PCL statement is useful for getting rid of unwanted
      text from a program such as startup messages.

   2. CLEARTYPEOUT is more efficient than doing a GETTYPEOUT and then  not
      using the returned data.

  Example

        COMMAND runprog (text (help "program to run"):prog_to_run);
        BEGIN
        ...
        INVOKE prog_to_run;
        ...
        CLEARTYPEOUT;
        ...
        TYPEIN "week";
        ...
        END

                                    COMMAND




8.10. COMMAND
  Function
  The  COMMAND  PCL  statement  keyword  indicates  the  beginning of a command
definition.
  Format

        Format 1.
                COMMAND name [ (command-arguments) ]
                PCL Statement;

        Format 2.
                COMMAND name [ (command-arguments) ]
                BEGIN
                [ declarations ]
                PCL Statement;
                PCL Statement;
                ...
                PCL Statement
                END

        command-arguments is:
           field-type [ (options) ] : variable-name;
           ...;
           field-type [ (options) ] : variable-name

        field-type, options:
           are defined as for PARSE (see page 42,
           and page 43)

        declarations is:
           type name1,name2,...;
                Declaring Local variables

           EXTERNAL type name1, name2,...;
                Declaring Global variables that will be used.
           EXTERNAL [ type ] PROCEDURE name1, name2,...;
                Declaring external procedures that will be called.
           ...

        type is:
           INTEGER   or
           STRING

  Notes

   1. The COMMAND keyword must be the first word in a command definition.

   2. Format 2 allows to declare local  variables,  references  to  global
      variables, and references to other PCL procedures.

   3. The  command  will  be called name.  It may contain any alphanumeric
      characters, including the underscore which will be  converted  to  a
      hyphen when it is entered into the Exec's command table.

   4. The commands arguments are optional. If given, the parameters to the
      command  are specified on the command declaration line, avoiding the
      use of PARSE.  The command may not do any explicit  PARSE  statement
      unless  it  uses  subcommands  with  PROMPT (see page 47).  For each
      field  parsed,  the  variable  associated  with   the   command   is
      automatically  declared  INTEGER  or  STRING and is set to $VALUE or
      $Atom, depending on the type of field parsed:

      integer         for KEYWORD, NUMBER, SWITCH
      string          for INPUTFILE, OUTPUTFILE, FILE,  FIELD,  DIRECTORY,
                      USERNAME,   DEVICE,   TEXT,  DAYTIME,  QUOTEDSTRING,
                      TOKEN, NODE.

   5. For example:

        COMMAND TRY (NOISE "Number";
                     NUMBER (Default "10") : number);
        begin
        display $string(number);
        end;

   6. More than one command declaration may appear in a source file.

  Example

        COMMAND newone;
        ...
        COMMAND more (number:job_val;text:entry_type);
        ...

                                    DECLARE




8.11. DECLARE
  Function
  EXEC  command  to  merge user written commands, procedures, or variables into
the EXEC.
  Format

        @DECLARE (for PCL) [ cfm ] option

        cfm is:
           /Confirm   or
           /NoConfirm

        option is:
           ENVIRONMENT (from file) FileName1 [ ,filename2 ... ]   or
           INTEGER-VARIABLE (named) integer-name   or
           PCL-ROUTINES (from file) FileName1 [ ,filename2 ... ]   or
           STRING-VARIABLE (named) string-name   or
           SYNONYM (to new name) new-name
                       (to old command named) command-name

  Notes

   1. The DECLARE command will confirm its action with a message typed  to
      the user's terminal.  The user may alter this default on a permanent
      basis  with  a  SET DEFAULT command.  To override the default or the
      SET status the user may specify the Confirm or NoConfirm switches.

   2. To DECLARE PCL routines the source files are specified by a list  of
      files  specification  separated  by  commas,  each specification may
      contain wildcards.  Each file specified is read,  compiled  into  an
      internal  format,  and  stored  in  the  EXEC.   The source file may
      contain  any  combination  of  procedures,  commands,  and  variable
      declarations.    If the user does not specify any file name then the
      source input is read from the terminal.  For procedures  which  will
      be  used  often,  the  EXEC  environment  should  be saved using the
      ENVIRONMENT option of the Exec @PRESERVE command.  This  environment
      may then be recalled with the DECLARE ENVIRONMENT command.  The user
      may  declare  a  command with the same name as a predefined command.
      If the user wishes  to  execute  the  predefined  command  then  the
      ORIGINAL command should be used.

   3. The  PCL  environment  is  the  entire  collection  of  user defined
      objects, which must have unique names.  This includes  commands  and
      variables.   The user may save the PCL environment at any time using
      the exec PRESERVE command.  To re-establish a  previous  environment
      use the ENVIRONMENT option of the DECLARE command.  The environments
      to  DECLARE  are  specified  by  a list of file specifications, each
      specification may contain wild cards.   The  default  file  name  is
      EXEC.ENV.  The  requested  environments are merged into the existing
      environment so all commands  and  variables  already  declared  will
      remain.

   4. The  INTEGER-VARIABLE  and  STRING-VARIABLE  options  to the DECLARE
      command will create variables in the EXEC which may be referenced by
      user written commands or procedures.  This provides a mechanism  for
      one  command to pass data to another command or for one global value
      that many commands may reference.  These variables may  be  assigned
      values  by  using the SET (see page 51) command if at the EXEC level
      or by a simple assignment statement if in a command.  The  user  may
      view  the  current  value  of  these  global  variables by using the
      INFORMATION VARIABLE command.

   5. The SYNONYM option declares a synonym name to  an  existing  command
      (Exec or PCL) .

  Example

        @DECLARE PCL-ROUTINE new-commands.pcl
        [Command GIGI defined]
        [Command GAPL defined]
        [Command GTYPE defined]
        [Command SAVE defined, old definition replaced]
        [Command GCOLOR defined]
        @DECLARE STRING-VARIABLE message

                                    DISPLAY




8.12. DISPLAY
  Function
  The DISPLAY PCL statement will type its argument on the terminal.
  Format

        DISPLAY [ option ] expression

        option is:
            NORETURN   or
            BINARY

        expression is:
            an integer or string expression

  Notes

   1. By  default,  DISPLAY will type out the string or number in ordinary
      character mode with a carriage return added.

   2. The NORETURN option will not type out the carriage return.

   3. The  BINARY  option  is  used  to  display  without  any   character
      conversion.    This  is  useful  for controlling display or graphics
      terminals.  It will not add a carriage return to the string.

   4. To concatenate strings  and  numbers  in  DISPLAY  use  the  $String
      procedure:  

        DISPLAY "Terminal length : " + $STRING($termlength);

  Example

        COMMAND showoff;
        BEGIN
        STRING status;
        INTEGER value;
        ...;
        DISPLAY "starting";
        ...;
        DISPLAY "Status : " + status;
        ...
        DISPLAY value * 37;
        ...;
        DISPLAY BINARY "$H$J";
        ...
        END
                                      DO




8.13. DO
  Function
  The DO PCL statement provides loop control within PCL commands.
  Format

        Format 1.
                DO PCL statement WHILE logical expression
        Format 2.
                DO PCL statement UNTIL logical expression

  Notes

   1. PCL statement may be any legal PCL statement or a BEGIN/END grouping
      of PCL statements.

   2. Format  1  will  loop  as  long  as  the logical expression is true.
      Presumably some statement in the PCL statement will alter  something
      that  is  being  tested in the logical expression.  Otherwise the DO
      may loop forever.  There is no ENDLOOP or ESCAPE command.  The  user
      may wish to GOTO out of the loop but this is not recommended.

   3. Format 2 will loop as long as the logical expression is false.  Once
      the test becomes true the loop terminates.

   4. Both  formats  will  execute at least once.  The logical expressions
      are not checked until after the PCL statements have been executed.

  Example

        command DoWhile;
        begin integer i;
        i = 5;
        DO begin display $string(i);i = i - 1 end WHILE i > 0;
        end

           Execution:

        @DoWhile
        5
        4
        3
        2
        1

                                   DOCOMMAND




8.14. DOCOMMAND
  Function
  The DOCOMMAND PCL statement passes commands to the EXEC.
  Format

        DOCOMMAND [ ORIGINAL ] string1 [ TO string2 ]

  Notes

   1. The  optional  keyword  ORIGINAL causes the DOCOMMAND to execute the
      EXEC's original definition of a command and not the user's  declared
      command.

   2. Normally,  Docommand  types  the  results  of  the  command  on  the
      terminal.

   3. If the optional TO string2 is specified docommand places the results
      of the command in String2. The output will be formatted  as  if  the
      Exec  were  typing to a terminal with a width of zero, since this is
      most easily parsed by programs.

   4. A carriage return will be added to the end of the string  containing
      the command.

   5. The DoCommand statement can be abbreviated DCM .

   6. A  Docommand  terminates  any  PARSE currently in progress. The best
      rule is not to use  any  Docommand  before  a  PARSE  EOL  has  been
      executed.

  Example

        COMMAND bigeez;
        DOCOMMAND "vdir,
                   larger 100

                   "
                                     EXIT




8.15. EXIT
  Function
  The EXIT PCL statement will cause the PCL command to return to the EXEC.
  Format

        EXIT [ option ]

        option is:
            SAVE   or
            TOPROGRAM

  Notes

   1. EXIT  will  always  go  back  to  the EXEC even if executed within a
      procedure.

   2. If the PCL command executes to the END of the command, an EXIT  will
      be simulated.

   3. It  is  permissible  to  have more than one exit in a PCL command or
      procedure.

   4. When a PCL command exits, any invoked programs are killed during the
      cleanup.  The SAVE option will  prevent  the  invoked  program  from
      being killed, and leaves it as if a ^C had been typed.

   5. The TOPROGRAM option acts as if the command was exited totally and a
      @continue was typed to the Exec for the invoked program.

  Example

        COMMAND checkvalue;
        BEGIN
         INTEGER count;
         ...;
         IF count > 6 THEN EXIT;
         ...;
         EXIT
        END

                                   EXTERNAL




8.16. EXTERNAL
  Function
  The  EXTERNAL  PCL  statement  allows  commands  to  use  externally  defined
procedures and global variables.
  Format

        EXTERNAL type name1 [ ,name2 ... ]   or

        EXTERNAL [ type ] PROCEDURE name1 [ ,name2 ... ]

        type is:
           INTEGER   or
           STRING

  Notes

   1. The "EXTERNAL type name" form allows a PCL command or  procedure  to
      reference  global  variables  (defined by INTEGER or STRING in a PCL
      source file, or by the Exec @Declare command).

   2. The "EXTERNAL [type] PROCEDURE name" form allows a  PCL  command  or
      procedure  to  reference  externally  defined  procedures  (typed or
      untyped).  If the type is not specified the procedure is  referenced
      by "CALL name", otherwise its name may be used as a variable name.

  Example

        COMMAND outside;
        BEGIN
         INTEGER int;
         EXTERNAL STRING message;
         EXTERNAL INTEGER PROCEDURE finger;
         EXTERNAL PROCEDURE mark;
         ...
         display message;
         int = finger;
         call mark;
         ...
        END

                                  GETTYPEOUT




8.17. GETTYPEOUT
  Function
  The  PCL  statement GETTYPEOUT will place the terminal output from an invoked
program into a string.
  Format

        GETTYPEOUT string

  Notes

   1. When a  GETTYPEOUT  statement  is  executed,  PCL  will  gather  all
      terminal  output  from the invoked program since the INVOKE or since
      the last GETTYPEOUT and put it in the  string.    When  the  invoked
      program  goes  into  terminal input wait, the GETTYPEOUT will return
      with the type out in the string.

   2. A  CLEARTYPEOUT  PCL  statement  is  more  efficient  that  doing  a
      GETTYPEOUT and then not using the returned data.

  Example

        COMMAND runprog (text (help "program to run"):prog_to_run);
        BEGIN
        STRING program_text;
        ...;
        INVOKE prog_to_run;
        ...;
        GETTYPEOUT program_text;
        ...
        END

                                     GOTO




8.18. GOTO
  Function
  The  GOTO statement alters the flow of execution of PCL.  It causes execution
to jump directly to a labeled statement (see  page  4).    Its  use  should  be
minimized because of the great possibility of confusion, but at times it may be
essential.
  Format

        GOTO label

  Notes

   1. The label must be defined somewhere in the command or procedure.

  Example

        COMMAND xfer;
         BEGIN
         ...;
         loop1:
         ...;
         GOTO loop1;
         ...
        END

                                     GUIDE




8.19. GUIDE
  Function
  The  GUIDE  statement  can be used in conjunction with the PARSE statement to
provide a pleasing user interface.  It tells the system that a particular guide
word is to be displayed if the user requests it by hitting the Escape key.   It
is equivalent to PARSE NOISE.
  Format

        GUIDE string-constant

  Notes

   1. The   GUIDE  statement  has  the  same  restrictions  as  the  PARSE
      statement:  It can not be used except where a command line is  being
      parsed.

   2. The  GUIDE  statement  is  actually a PARSE statement with the NOISE
      field-type.

  Example

        GUIDE "Input File";
        PARSE FILE (INPUT);

                                  IF ... ELSE




8.20. IF ... ELSE
  Function
  IF ... ELSE provides the conditional execution of PCL statements depending on
testing integer or string expressions.
  Format

        IF logical-expression THEN
            PCL-statement
        [ ELSE
            PCL-statement ]

  Notes

   1. If the expression is true then the statement after THEN is executed;
      otherwise the ELSE statement is executed.

   2. The  ELSE part is optional. If omitted it corresponds to a Null ELSE
      (ie if the test fails then nothing is executed).

   3. IF ... ELSE may be cascaded (although CASE or SELECT might  be  more
      appropriate if the cascade is lengthy).

  Example

        IF $value < 10 then display "less than 10"
        ELSE IF $value <100 then display "more than 9 but less than 100"
        ELSE display "More than 99";

                                  INFORMATION




8.21. INFORMATION
  Function
  New  options  to  the  EXEC  INFORMATION  command  give information about the
current PCL environment.  
  Format

        INFORMATION (About) DEFAULTS (For) DECLARE
        INFORMATION (About) PCL-OBJECTS
        INFORMATION (About) VARIABLE string

  Notes

   1. The DEFAULTS DECLARE option  lists  the  defaults  for  the  DECLARE
      command.    The  defaults for the DECLARE command are also listed by
      INFORMATION DEFAULTS ALL.

   2. The  PCL-OBJECTS  option  lists  the  names  of  all  the  commands,
      procedures,  and variables that are currently declared in the user's
      EXEC.  This provides a way for the user to see exactly what commands
      have been  established  and  avoid  any  confusion  about  redefined
      commands.

   3. The  VARIABLE  option  will display the current value of a string or
      integer variable which was declared by the  DECLARE  STRING-VARIABLE
      or  the  DECLARE  INTEGER-VARIABLE  commands.    It does not display
      values for variables declared inside commands or procedures.

  Example

        @INFORMATION (ABOUT) PCL
         Commands: DRP, REMIND, NETMAILCHECK, DIALUPLINE, COURIER
         Procedures: MATCH
         Variables: String MESSAGE
        @
        @set string message (TO) grades are due today
        @info var message
         grades are due today

8.22. INTEGER - STRING
  Function
  The  INTEGER  (STRING)  statement  declares  variables  to be of type integer
(String). If inside a command  it  defines  it  as  a  variable  local  to  the
procedure; otherwise it defines a global variable.
  Format

        INTEGER var1 [ , var2... ]  or
        STRING  var1 [ , var2... ]

  Notes

   1. In PCL every variable must be declared by a type statement.

   2. If a global variable is referenced in a command or procedure it must
      be declared with an EXTERNAL statement.

  Example

        INTEGER today,tomorrow;         ! dates in internal format
        STRING mydir;                   ! current directory

                                    INVOKE




8.23. INVOKE
  Function
  The  PCL statement INVOKE will start a program running in a lower fork.  This
provides the program with only a simple form of terminal I/O; it is possible to
make programs which expect more advanced terminal control than PCL can provide.
  Format

        INVOKE [PASSOUTPUT] string

  Notes

   1. INVOKE should be used when the user wishes to control  the  type  in
      and type out of the invoked program.

   2. After  PCL  starts  the  program, it waits for the program to either
      halt or wait for terminal input.

   3. If the PCL command exits before the program completes,  the  invoked
      program will be left in a ^C state.

   4. Data  may  be  sent to the invoked program using the TYPEIN command.
      Type out from the program  may  be  retrieved  with  the  GETTYPEOUT
      command.

   5. If the PASSOUTPUT option is used all output from the program is sent
      directly  to  the  terminal.    This  eliminates  the  need  to do a
      GETTYPEOUT and a DISPLAY.

   6. The PASSOUTPUT option can be abbreviated PASO.

  Example

        COMMAND runprog (text (help "program to run"):prog_to_run);
        BEGIN
        ...;
        INVOKE prog_to_run;
        ...
        END

8.24. KILLPROGRAM
  Function
  The KILLPROGRAM PCL statement will terminate an invoked program.
  Format

        KILLPROGRAM

  Notes

   1. KILLPROGRAM  will  ^C the invoked program and then do a RESET on the
      fork.

  Example

        COMMAND runprog (text (help "program to run"):prog_to_run);
        BEGIN
        STRING program_text;
        ...;
        INVOKE prog_to_run;
        ...;
        GETTYPEOUT program_text;

                                      NOP




8.25. NOP
  Function
  The NOP statement performs exactly Nothing.
  Format

        NOP

  Notes

   1. NOP may be used to clarify the intent of a procedure.  

  Example

        CASE $value FROM 1 TO 6 OF BEGIN
           1 TO 3  : {some code};
           4       : NOP;               !If 4, do exactly nothing
           INRANGE : {code if 5 or 6};
           END;

                                  NOORIGINAL




8.26. NOORIGINAL
  Function
  The NOORIGINAL PCL statement undeclares an original exec command.
  Format

        NOORIGINAL command-name

  Notes

   1. This  command  is  placed  in  PCL source files, but may not be used
      inside a command or procedure. Its use is  equivalent  to  the  Exec
      "@UNDECLARE ORIGINAL-COMMAND" command.

   2. The  command  thus  undeclared  does  not  appear  when querying the
      available commands with "?" but it may still  be  invoked  with  the
      "@ORIGINAL" Exec command (see page 41).

  Example

        NOORIGINAL ARCHIVE;

8.27. ORIGINAL
  Function
  The  Exec @Original command allows to run an original command even if PCL has
defined an other command by the same name, or if it has been undeclared by  the
Exec   "@UNDECLARE   ORIGINAL-COMMAND"  command  or  by  the  PCL  "NOORIGINAL"
declaration.
  Format

        @ORIGINAL (Exec Command) command-name  command-arguments

                                     PARSE




8.28. PARSE
  Function
  The  PARSE  PCL  statement  is used to read command input parameters from the
terminal.  Specific types of parameters may be requested  such  as  numbers  or
input  file  specifications.    Refer  to the parse introduction page 10 for an
introduction to the working of PARSE.
  Format

        Format 1.
              PARSE field-type [ (field-option; ... ) ]

        Format 2.
              PARSE
                 BEGIN
                 field-type [ (field-option; ... ) ] [ : PCL statement ];
                 field-type [ (field-option; ... ) ] [ : PCL statement ];
                 . . .
                 END

        field-type is:
           the type of atom parsed, cfr infra

        field-option is:
           options modifying the parse, cfr infra

        Format 1 is called a simple parse. Format 2 is a complex parse,
        allowing to parse one of several possible field types.

  Example

        COMMAND getinfo;
        BEGIN
        STRING type_in;
        PARSE text;
        type_in = $ATOM;

              END;
           number   :
              BEGIN
              the_job = $VALUE;
              DOCOMMAND "systat " + $string(the_job)
              END
           END
           ;
        ...
        END

  To the user, the above command choice would look like:  

        @decl pcl choice
        [Command CHOICE defined]
        @
        @choice ? user name
          or decimal number
        @choice te04
          14    42  EMACS   TE04
        @choice 10
          10    13  OPR     IO00
        @

  The following command defines a keyword to be parsed.  

        COMMAND keywd;
        BEGIN
         ...;
         PARSE KEYWORD ( WORDS("day":1, "week":2, "year":3) );
         ...
        END

  To the user, the keywd command would look like:  

        @keywd ? one of the following:
         DAY    WEEK    YEAR
        @keywd day

  Notes

   1. The parse field types are a subset of the COMND JSYS Function  codes
      for  the expected field to be parsed.  For a complete description of
      the actions of these fields, see their corresponding description  in
      the  TOPS-20 MONITOR CALLS manual.  The legal field types are listed
      page 42.

   2. The last atom typed by the user is returned in  $xatom  (except  for
      FileList,  DirectoryList  and  UserList). The complete command up to
      the last atom parsed is in $command.

   3. The values for NUMBER, the integer-constant in a KEYWORD  or  SWITCH
      (see below), and the internal date and time for DAYTIME are returned
      in $VALUE.

   4. The  value  for  file  parses is returned in system variables $Parse
      (see page 7), and $filen, $FileL, $FileS and $FileV (see page 7).

   5. The  text  typed  in  for  NUMBER,  FIELD,  DEVICE,   TEXT,   TOKEN,
      QUOTEDSTRING,  DIRECTORY,  USERNAME,  KEYWORD,  SWITCH,  and NODE is
      returned in $ATOM.

   6. Each  Field  type  may  have  optional  Field  Options  enclosed  in
      parentheses  and separated by commas. These options modify or extend
      the parse type of the field; they are closely Related to the  COMAND
      JSYS.  The parse field options are described page 43.

   7. PARSE  takes  care  of re-parsing and redisplay if the user corrects
      the command line.  The PCL author should code the command as  though
      the user will never make a mistake or change what was typed in.

   8. Once  an  EOL  has  been  parsed,  no  more  PARSE statements may be
      executed without first doing a PROMPT statement to reinitialize  the
      parsing system.  Reparsing will occur only back to the last executed
      prompt statement.

   9. A  DoCommand statement generates an implicit Parse EOL statement, to
      require that commands first parse their parameters and then  perform
      their  actions.  Subsequent PARSE must thus be preceded by a PROMPT.
      If you fail  to  follow  this  rule,  stange  failures  may  happen,
      including  falling  back  in the standard exec if you delete too far
      back, etc.

  10. The GUIDE statement is equivalent to PARSE NOISE;



8.28.1. Parse Field Types
  The legal parse field types are:

COMMA           parses a comma.  Spaces may appear on either side of the comma.

DAYTIME         inputs a date and time  field.    The  format  is  any  general
                date/time  format.    Both date and time must be entered unless
                the date or time parse options are  specified.    The  date  is
                returned  in  internal  form in $Value, and in expanded form in
                $atom.

DEVICE          parses a device name, including the closing ":".   Returned  in
                $atom (without the closing ":").

DIRECTORY       parses   a   directory  name,  including  the  angle  brackets.
                Returned in $atom, fully expanded as device:<directory>.

DIRECTORYLIST   allows the user to enter a list  of  directories  separated  by
                commas. Each directory specification may contain wildcards. The
                $NEXTDIRECTORY system procedure allows to loop through the list
                of directories matching the list. The current directory name is
                returned  in the $Directory system variable. (See page 10). The
                system variable $xatom does not work for this field type.

EOL             is used to parse a carriage return. If the user is doing simple
                parses then the command will continue  to  execute  after  each
                parse.    Once  a  PARSE  EOL has been executed the PCL command
                cannot do any more  PARSE  statements.    See  the  PROMPT  PCL
                statement  on  page  47.    It  is  not  necessary,  nor  is it
                permitted, to specify a EOL when using command arguments.

FIELD           parses an arbitrary parameter delimited  by  a  nonalphanumeric
                character.    No  standard help message is available.  (See the
                HELP field option, page 43).  Returned in $atom.

FILE            is more general than  INPUTFILE  and  OUTPUTFILE  (cfr  infra).
                This  field type has many more options available.  Defaults may
                be specified for any of the file  specification  fields.    The
                user  may  specify  that  the field is to be "parse only" which
                merely checks for a  valid  file  specification.    (See  field
                options  DEFAULT_DEV,  DEFAULT_DIR,  DEFAULT_EXT,  DEFAULT_GEN,
                DEFAULT_NAM, INPUT, OUTPUT, and WILD.)  It is not  possible  to
                have more than one FILE field in a single Parse statement.  The
                file  name is returned under various forms in the $File* system
                variables (see page 7) and $parse (see page 7).

FILELIST        allows the user to enter a list of files separated  by  commas.
                Each  file  specification may contain wildcards.  The $NEXTFILE
                system procedure allows to loop through the  files  that  match
                the  list.  The current file is returned in the same way as for
                the FILE field type (cfr supra).  The  system  variable  $xatom
                does not work for this field type.

INPUTFILE       allows  the  user  to specify a file that already exists.  This
                field type does not allow any fields of the file  specification
                to  be defaulted. (See FILE and FILELIST field types.  The file
                is returned in the same way as for the  FILE  field  type  (cfr
                supra).

KEYWORD         allows a list of keywords to be specified.  The user may select
                one  of the keywords in the list.  The list is defined by using
                the WORDS field option (see page 43).  The  keyword  string  is
                returned in $atom, and the value associated with it is returned
                in $value.

NODE            parses  a  network  node name.  This must be an available node,
                unless the PARSEONLY option is specified.  Returned in $atom.

NOISE string-constant
                mostly used for command arguments.  This field type will  cause
                the  text  in  the string to be typed out in parentheses if the
                user types an escape. The command GUIDE "text" is equivalent to
                PARSE NOISE "text".

NUMBER          parses an integer input field.  The RADIX field  option  allows
                for  numbers  in  some  radix other than 10 (see page 43).  The
                value is returned in $value, and the string in $atom.

OTHERWISE       is a special field-type which is meaningful only in the complex
                Parse (see page 10).  If specified, it must be the  last  field
                in  the  Parse  statement.  The Otherwise case will be taken if
                the input available matches none of the field  types  provided.
                The  otherwise field type does not consume any of the input; it
                only indicates that it was not recognizable.

OUTPUTFILE      causes the system to parse for a file name that does not exist.
                This  field  type  does  not  allow  any  fields  of  the  file
                specification   to  be  defaulted.    Wild  cards  may  not  be
                specified.  The file is returned in the same  way  as  for  the
                FILE field type (cfr supra).

QUOTEDSTRING    parses  a  field  contained  in  double  quotes.   The field is
                returned in $ATOM without the quotes.

SWITCH          is similar to KEYWORD except that  a  list  of  switches  (i.e.
                KEYWORDS  preceded  by a slash) is parsed.  The list is defined
                by using the WORDS field  option  (see  page  43).  The  switch
                string  is  returned  in  $atom,  and  the  associated value in
                $value.

TEXT            parses all the input up to the carriage return.    Returned  in
                $ATOM.

TOKEN string-constant
                parses  a  field  that exactly matches the string.  Returned in
                $atom.

USERLIST        allows the user to enter a list  of  directories  separated  by
                commas.  Each  user  specification  may  contain wildcards. The
                $NEXTUSER system procedure allows to loop through the  list  of
                users  matching  the list. The current user name is returned in
                the $USER system variable. (See page 10). The  system  variable
                $xatom does not work for this field type.

USERNAME        parses a username (without angle brackets).  Returned in $atom.



8.28.2. Parse Field Options
  The  Field  options  directly related to parsing file names (File, InputFile,
OutputFile, and FileList) are:

DEFAULT_DEV string
                For FILE and FILELIST fields, specify the default  device.  The
                string  may  be a string constant or a user string variable. It
                may not include the field delimiters (: for  device,  <..>  for
                the  directory,  etc).    The  string given may not be a string
                expression (eg formed by concatenation), nor  a  string  system
                variable:  

        mydir = $ConnectedDirectory;
        PARSE (FILE (DEFAULT_DEV "DSK",
                     DEFAULT_DIR mydir));

DEFAULT_DIR string
                For  FILE  and  FILELIST fields, specify the default directory.
                The allowed forms of String are the same as for Default_dev.

DEFAULT_NAM string
                For FILE and FILELIST fields, specify the  default  file  name.
                The allowed forms of String are the same as for Default_dev.

DEFAULT_EXT string
                For  FILE  and  FILELIST fields, specify the default extension.
                The allowed forms of String are the same as for Default_dev.

DEFAULT_GEN code
                For FILE and FILELIST fields, specify the  default  generation.
                The  codes  are  0 (highest generation), + (next generation), -
                (first  generation),  *  (all  generations),  or  a  generation
                number:  

        PARSE (FILE (DEFAULT_GEN 0));
        PARSE (FILE (DEFAULT_GEN +));

DELETED         For  field  types FILE and FILELIST, parses for a deleted file.
                Turns on COMAND JSYS bit GJ%DEL.

INPUT           For field types FILE and FILELIST, parses for an existing file.
                Turns on COMAND JSYS bit GJ%OLD.

INVISIBLE       For field types FILE and  FILELIST,  parses  for  an  invisible
                file.  Turns on COMAND JSYS bit GJ%IIN.

OUTPUT          For  field  types  FILE  and  FILELIST,  parses for a new file.
                Turns on COMAND JSYS bit GJ%FOU.

PARSEONLY       For file parses, allows the command  to  parse  for  a  validly
                formatted  file  specification  without requiring that the file
                actually exist.  For Node parses, allows the node not to exist;
                similarly for Device, Directory, and User.  The string that the
                user enters for this field will be returned in $ATOM.

WILD            For FILE field type, allows the user to specify  a  wild  card.
                This   allows   to   step   through   the  files  matching  the
                specification in the same way as  for  a  FILELIST.    See  the
                FILELIST  field  option  for  the  most  general file wild card
                parsing method.

  The Fields options not directly related to file name parsing are:

DATE            Parse only the date for field type DAYTIME.

DEFAULT string  Specifies that the field may be skipped and  that  the  default
                value should be string.  String may be either a string constant
                or  a  user  string variable. It may not be a string expression
                (eg formed by concatenation) nor a string  PCL  variable  (like
                $ConnectedDirectory).

ERROR           For  command  arguments only, branch to label on a parse error.
                In complex parse use the OTHERWISE field-type.

HELP string     If the user enters a ? at the field prompt, the help message in
                string is displayed.  String may be either a string constant or
                a user string variable. It may not be a string  expression  (eg
                formed  by  concatenation)  nor  a  string  PCL  variable (like
                $ConnectedDirectory).  By default the use of this option  turns
                off  the system default help. If you wish to append the default
                help message, give the STDHELP option after the HELP option:  

        PARSE KEYWORD (WORDS ("Usage":1, "Days_unreferenced":2),
                       HELP "Next Field for Sorting", STDHELP ) ;
        Will give the ? help:
        ?Next field for sorting, one of the following:
        Days-Unreferenced   Usage

NOHELP          Suppresses the default system help. This is the default if  you
                use the HELP option.

NOINDIRECT      Specifies that an indirect command file may not be used at this
                field.  Turns on bit CM%XIF in the COMAND JSYS.

RADIX Integer-constant
                For field type NUMBER, specifies that the number typed in is in
                radix integer constant.

STDHELP         Use  the  standard  help message provided by Tops20, eventually
                appending it to the HELP option help text (in this case STDHELP
                must be given after the HELP option.  Not  applicable  for  the
                field type FIELD.

TIME            Parse only the time for field type DAYTIME.

WILD            For  the DIRECTORY and USERNAME field types, allows the user to
                specify  a  wild  card.  This  allows  to  step   through   the
                directories or users matching the specification in the same way
                as  for a DIRECTORYLIST or USERLIST.  See these field-types for
                the most general wild card parsing method.

WORDS (word1 : int1 [,word2 : int2 ...])
                or

WORDS (word1 :: int1 [,word2 :: int2 ...])
                 For the field types KEYWORD and SWITCH, the WORDS option gives
                the list of keywords (or switches).  Each word may be:

                a string enclosed in double quotes
                                for example "68_cobol". This is  the  Preferred
                                syntax; it is needed for words which start with
                                a digit.

                a number        an integer number like 123.

                a word          an  alphanumeric  string beginning by a letter,
                                like a13.

                The integer after the ":" will be stored in $value. The  second
                form  of  the  WORDS  option,  wich  uses  "::" is reserved for
                parsing SWITCHes of the form: "/delete:"; it may not be used in
                command arguments, but only in PARSE statements.

                If an underscore ("_") appears within a word  it  is  converted
                into a hyphen ("-").

                For example:  

        PARSE BEGIN
           KEYWORD  (WORDS ("blue":1, "red":2),
                     HELP "Select Colour", STDHELP)
            : colour = $value;
           OTHERWISE: display "Invalid colour";
           END;

8.29. PRESERVE
  Function
  The  PRESERVE command allows the user to save the current PCL environment for
later recall.  It allows system administrators to modify the Exec with PCL  and
then save the entire Exec for use at his or her site.
  Format

        PRESERVE option file-name

        option is:
           ENVIRONMENT
           EXEC

  Notes

   1. An  ENVIRONMENT  is  all the PCL commands, procedures, and variables
      that the user has defined.

   2. The ENVIRONMENT file contains the internal, compiled version of  the
      PCL objects.  It will not be recompiled when declared.

   3. The default file name for environments is EXEC.ENV.

   4. Format 2 is for system administrators.  The EXEC that is written may
      be  placed  on  <SYSTEM>  for use by the installation.  All commands
      that have been defined may not be un-declared by the users.

   5. The default file name for PRESERVE EXEC is EXEC.EXE.

  Example

        PRESERVE ENVIRONMENT  payroll.env
        PRESERVE EXEC exec.exe

                                   PROCEDURE




8.30. PROCEDURE
  Function
  A  PROCEDURE  definition  in  a  PCL  source  file  creates a procedure.  All
procedures are declared globally and on the "top level;"  there  are  no  inner
procedures.
  Format

        [ type ] PROCEDURE name [ (arguments) ]

        arguments is:
           arglist [ ; arglist ... ]

        arglist is:
           type param1 [ ,param2... ]

        type is:
           INTEGER   or
           STRING

  Notes

   1. A  PROCEDURE  need  not  have  arguments;  if  it  has none then the
      parentheses are not necessary.

   2. A PROCEDURE, may have either INTEGER arguments, STRING arguments, or
      both. The string and integer arguments may appear in  any  order  in
      the arguments list.

   3. The  procedure  may  change the value of its arguments. The modified
      value is returned to the caller. In this case the argument must be a
      variable.

   4. If the type is not given the procedure is untyped and must be CALLed
      (see page 21).

   5. If type is given the procedure is typed.  The  type  may  be  either
      INTEGER  or  STRING. The procedure must return a result of that type
      (see the RETURN statement on page 48).  A  typed  procedure  may  be
      used in place of a variable in PCL statements.

   6. Specifying  the names of the parameters in the argument list defines
      them for all purposes; they need not be declared  again  within  the
      body of the procedure.

  Example

        PROCEDURE match (string input_string,str_match;
                         integer start_point);
        BEGIN
        ...;
        RETURN
        END

  If  a  user has an integer procedure called finger that looks at a SYSTAT and
returns the job number of the requested user, that procedure could be used:  

        COMMAND findem (username:guy);
                BEGIN
                 EXTERNAL INTEGER PROCEDURE finger;
                 IF finger(guy) neq -1 THEN
                  DISPLAY guy + " is at " + $string(finger(guy))
                 ELSE
                  DISPLAY guy + "not on";
                 EXIT
                END

The procedure finger would look like:  

        INTEGER PROCEDURE FINGER (STRING name);
        BEGIN
         STRING gotem;
         DOCOMMAND "systat " + name TO gotem;
        IF $length(gotem) = 0 THEN return -1
        ELSE return $integer(gotem[3:2])
        END

                                    PROMPT




8.31. PROMPT
  Function
  When  using  PARSE  to  parse  parameters,  it  only permits you to parse one
command line; once the line has been completely parsed, with PARSE EOL, you can
not use PARSE again, without causing PCL to obtain  and  begin  parsing  a  new
command  line.    The PROMPT PCL statement allows the PCL command to prompt for
more input parameters after a PARSE EOL has been executed.
  Format

        PROMPT [ NOECHO ] string

  Notes

   1. The  PROMPT  statement  allows  the  user  to  have  subcommands  to
      commands.

   2. After a PROMPT statement, the user may again do PARSE statements.

   3. The  NOECHO option turns off echoing for that entire line of command
      typein; this must be done at the Prompt because of the  way  command
      typein and echoing is done.

   4. In  command  parsing,  it  is  permissible for the user to type in a
      field and have it recognized by PCL and then to type enough  rubouts
      or  ^W to make the entire field invalid, or even an earlier, already
      parsed field.  When this happens, the system  signals  to  the  Exec
      that  a  "reparse"  occurred, and that the system will now reset its
      internal pointer to the beginning of  the  command  line  and  start
      again.    When  a reparse happens during basic command line parsing,
      PCL aborts the executing command completely and restarts the command
      program from the beginning.   During  subcommand  parsing,  this  is
      undesirable.    Instead,  when  a  reparse  occurs during subcommand
      parsing (properly identified as such by  a  PROMPT  statement),  PCL
      jumps  back  to  the last-executed Prompt statement as if a GoTo had
      been performed and resumes execution of the PCL  program  from  that
      point.  Then, when the user's Parse statements re-execute, they will
      match the fields which the system will re-present to the program.

  Example

        COMMAND subcomm;
         BEGIN INTEGER a_value;
         PARSE NUMBER;
         a_value = $VALUE
         ...;
         PARSE EOL;
         ...;
         PROMPT "@@";
         PARSE KEYWORD ( Words("first":1, "last":2, "all":3));
         ...;
         PARSE EOL;
         PROMPT NOECHO "Please enter your password: "
         PARSE TEXT;
         ...
         END

                                    RETURN




8.32. RETURN
  Function
  The RETURN PCL statement causes a procedure to return to the calling routine.
  Format

        RETURN [ expression ]

  Notes

   1. A  RETURN  always  returns to the calling routine.  If in a command,
      the command returns to the EXEC.

   2. The  optional  expression  must  be  provided  if  within  a   typed
      procedure,  and  must  be  of  the  same  type as the procedure.  It
      defines the value returned by the procedure (see page 46).

  Example

        PROCEDURE show;
         BEGIN
          display $jobno + " " + $username;
          RETURN
         END
        INTEGER PROCEDURE calc;
        BEGIN
         INTEGER total;
         ...;
         RETURN total + 5
        END

                                    SELECT




8.33. SELECT
  Function
  The SELECT statement provides an orderly way of choosing one of several paths
to  take  based  on  the current value of an integer or string expression.  The
statement tagged with the expression having the same value is executed, and all
others are ignored.
  Format

        SELECT test_expression OF BEGIN
          test : PCL-statement;
          test : PCL-statement;
          ..
          END;

        test is:
          tag1 [ , tag2 ... ]

        tag is:
          expression   or
          expression1 TO expression2   or
          OTHERWISE

  Notes

   1. All the tags expressions must be  of  the  same  type  as  the  test
      expression (ie integer or string).

   2. Unlike  the  CASE  statement,  the  tags  may be complex expressions
      instead of constants.  After evaluating the select  expression,  PCL
      will  evaluate each tagging expression in turn and compare the value
      to the value of the select expression.    If  they  are  equal,  the
      corresponding  statement  will  be  executed.  Execution  will  then
      proceed after the SELECT statement.

   3. The OTHERWISE keyword indicates that the tagged statement is  to  be
      executed  if all the preceding tests fail. If present, the OTHERWISE
      must be the only tag in a test, and should be the last test given.

   4. If all the tests fail, and there is  no  OTHERWISE,  then  execution
      continues following the SELECT statement.

   5. The  intent  of providing SELECT in addition to CASE is that CASE is
      implemented  with  a  table  of  statement  addresses,   making   it
      appropriate for small ranges of the selection expression, say from 1
      to  10,  whereas  SELECT  is  implemented by a series of tests which
      might as well have been coded by user statements like:

        IF x=1 THEN s1
        ELSE IF x=58 THEN s2
        ELSE IF x=101 THEN s3
        ELSE ...

      This form is suitable for a large range in the selection range.

  Example

        ...
        SELECT $Value OF BEGIN
           1 TO 3, 100 : {executed if $value
                          is between 1 and 3, or 100};
           6,9         : {executed if $value is 6 or 9};
           OTHERWISE   : {executed if none of the above};
           END;
        ...


        COMMAND seltest(USERNAME:unam);
        ...
        SELECT unam OF
           BEGIN
           "OPERATOR":    display "the operator";
           "DIAGNOSTICS": display "the engineers"
           END
        END

                                   SELECTALL




8.34. SELECTALL
  Function
  The  SELECTALL  statement is very similar to the SELECT statement except that
after a match has  been  found,  the  testing  continues  ("falls  through  the
SelectAll" so that multiple PCL statements may be selected one after the other.
  Format

        SELECTALL test_expression OF BEGIN
          test : PCL-statement;
          test : PCL-statement;
          ..
          END;

        test is:
          tag1 [ , tag2 ... ]

        tag is:
          expression   or
          expression1 TO expression2   or
          ALWAYS   or
          OTHERWISE

  Notes

   1. All  the  tags  expressions  must  be  of  the same type as the test
      expression (ie integer or string).

   2. Unlike the CASE statement,  the  tags  may  be  complex  expressions
      instead  of  constants.  After evaluating the select expression, PCL
      will evaluate each tagging expression in turn and compare the  value
      to  the  value  of  the  select  expression.  If they are equal, the
      corresponding statement will be executed. After that  the  execution
      proceeds  by  testing against the next tests in the SELECTALL, until
      all tests have been made.

   3. The OTHERWISE tag matches if no  previous  test  matched.  Within  a
      test, it must be the only tag.

   4. The  ALWAYS  tag  matches any expression. For this reason, OTHERWISE
      should always precede any ALWAYS. If present ALWAYS  must  the  only
      tag in a test.

   5. SELECTALL  must  be  used  where a SELECT would be used and multiple
      successive selections are needed.

  Example

        SELECTALL $value OF BEGIN
           1 TO 3    : {executed if $value is between 1 and 3}
           1, 5      : {executed if $value is 1 or 5}
           OTHERWISE : {executed if $value is not 1, 2, 3 or 5}
           ALWAYS    : {executed whatever the value of $value}
           END;

8.35. SET
  Function
  New  options  to the EXEC SET command will set the values of global variables
declared by the DECLARE command.
  Format

        SET INTEGER-VARIABLE (named) variable (to) value

        SET STRING-VARIABLE (named) variable (to) value

        SET [ NO ] COMMAND-TRACE (OF GENERATED COMMANDS)

        SET DEFAULT DECLARE /CONFIRM
                            /NOCONFIRM

  Notes

   1. The variable  must  have  been  previously  declared  by  a  DECLARE
      command. see page 25.

   2. The  INFORMATION  command  may  be  used to display the setting of a
      global variable. see page 35.

   3. Setting COMMAND-TRACE causes PCL to  display  at  the  terminal  all
      DoCommand statements as they are executed.

   4. Setting  the  default  for  DECLARE  allows  you  to say whether the
      DECLARE command should, by default, confirm its actions.

8.36. SYNONYM
  Function
  The SYNONYM command defines a synonym to an original Exec command.
  Format

        SYNONYM new-name original-name

  Notes

   1. The  SYNONYM command may not be given inside a command or procedure.
      It is used in PCL source files in the same way as the Exec "@DECLARE
      SYNONYM" command (see page 25).

  Example

        SYNONYM AuRevoir LOGOUT

                                    TYPEIN




8.37. TYPEIN
  Function
  The TYPEIN PCL statement will send a character string to an invoked program.
  Format

        TYPEIN [ NORETURN ] string

  Notes

   1. TYPEIN will send string to the invoked program as though it had been
      typed  on the controlling terminal.  A carriage return will be added
      to string, unless the NORETURN option is specified.

   2. Several lines may be sent to the invoked  program  with  one  TYPEIN
      statement.    PCL  will  strip  the extra line feeds from the string
      before sending it, because programs normally expect  their  terminal
      input to be terminated by carriage returns only.  

        TYPEIN "tape copytp:
                density 1600
                ssname area backup"

   3. After the string has been passed to the program, PCL waits until the
      program either halts or waits for more terminal input.

  Example

        COMMAND runprog (text (help "program to run"):prog_to_run);
        BEGIN
        STRING program_text;
        ...;
        INVOKE prog_to_run;
        ...;
        GETTYPEOUT program_text;
        ...;

  WILD  option  allowed  for  FILE,  DIRECTORY  and USERNAME parse field types.
$NEXTFILE working after PARSE (FILE (WILD)).

  DIRECTORYLIST and USERLIST parse field type, with  associated  variables  and
procedures $DIRECTORY, $USER, $NEXTDIRECTORY and $NEXTUSER.

  Based numbers of the form base%number.

  $Getfield and $Setfield to manipulate bit fields within integers.

  $and and $or to provide logical and/or of integers.

  $DirectoryInfo_I  and  $DirectoryInfo_s  read the information returned by the
GTDIR and GTDAL JSYS's.

  $FileInfo_I, $FileInfo_S, $FileSet accept mnemonic codes for the  information
desired. They also accept the file name as a string argument in addition to the
usual $parse or channel number.

  $FileSet sets individual entries in the FDB.

  $xatom and $command, return the last atom parsed and the last command parsed.

  $termlength returns the length of the controlling terminal.

  A jsys interface is provided with the routines:

$get_men and $Ret_mem
                to acquire and release memory

$iput and $iget to set/read integers in memory

$sput and $sget do the same for strings

$jfn            returns the jfn associated with a channel

$strloc         returns the address in memory of a string

$jsys, $Jsys1   execute a Jsys

$ac1 to $ac4    return the accumulators 1 to 4 after $jsys or $jsys1

$jsysok         indicates the success or failure of the last $jsys or $jsys1

  Inline  comments of the form !{...}! are allowed. They may span several lines
and may be nested.

  {...} may serve as a substitute to Begin...End.

  Case and Select may have multiple tags in each case; each tag may be  of  the
form Value1 TO Value2.

  The  SelectAll statement implements a select that "falls through" and goes on
matching (it is to Select in PCL as Select is to Selectone in Bliss).

  The WORDS option allows quoted strings:  

        (WORDS ("68_cobol":1, ...))

  $Isfile (Filename) returns 1 if a file exists, else 0.

  In $string if the radix is other than 10 the number is  output  in  magnitude
form, ignoring the sign bit.
