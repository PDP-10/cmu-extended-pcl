Original PCL:
        PS:<PCL5.BINARY-AND-BUILD-FILES>
        PS:<PCL5.DOC>
        PS:<PCL5.EXE>
        PS:<PCL5.MODIFS-AND-BUILD-FILES>
        PS:<PCL5.SOURCES>
Extended PCL:
        PS:<PCL5.X-BINARY-AND-BUILD-FILES>
        PS:<PCL5.X-DOC>
        PS:<PCL5.X-EXE>
        PS:<PCL5.X-MODIFS-AND-BUILD-FILES>
        PS:<PCL5.X-SOURCES>

  The major extensions are:

   - WILD option allowed for FILE,  DIRECTORY  and  USERNAME  parse  field
     types.  $NEXTFILE working after PARSE (FILE (WILD)).

   - DIRECTORYLIST   and   USERLIST  parse  field  type,  with  associated
     variables  and  procedures  $DIRECTORY,  $USER,  $NEXTDIRECTORY   and
     $NEXTUSER.

   - Based numbers of the form base%number.

   - $Getfield and $Setfield to manipulate bit fields within integers.

   - $and and $or to provide logical and/or of integers.

   - $DirectoryInfo_I  and  $DirectoryInfo_s read the information returned
     by the GTDIR and GTDAL JSYS's.

   - $FileInfo_I, $FileInfo_S, $FileSet  accept  mnemonic  codes  for  the
     information  desired.  They  also  accept  the  file name as a string
     argument in addition to the usual $parse or channel number.

   - $FileSet sets individual entries in the FDB.

   - $xatom and $command, return the last atom parsed and the last command
     parsed.

   - $termlength returns the length of the controlling terminal.

   - A jsys interface is provided with the routines:

     $get_men and $Ret_mem
                     to acquire and release memory

     $iput and $iget to set/read integers in memory

     $sput and $sget do the same for strings

     $jfn            returns the jfn associated with a channel

     $strloc         returns the address in memory of a string

     $jsys, $Jsys1   execute a Jsys

     $ac1 to $ac4    return the accumulators 1 to 4 after $jsys or $jsys1

     $jsysok         indicates the success or failure of the last $jsys or
                     $jsys1

   - Inline comments of the  form  !{...}!  are  allowed.  They  may  span
     several lines and may be nested.

   - {...} may serve as a substitute to Begin...End.

   - Case  and Select may have multiple tags in each case; each tag may be
     of the form Value1 TO Value2.

   - The SelectAll statement implements a select that "falls through"  and
     goes on matching (it is to Select in PCL as Select is to Selectone in
     Bliss).

   - The WORDS option allows quoted strings:  

        (WORDS ("68_cobol":1, ...))

   - $Isfile (Filename) returns 1 if a file exists, else 0.

   - In  $string  if  the  radix  is other than 10 the number is output in
     magnitude form, ignoring the sign bit.
