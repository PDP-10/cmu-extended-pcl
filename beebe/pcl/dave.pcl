COMMAND DAVE;
!------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Purpose:
!	Execute DAVE - the University of Colorado FORTRAN data flow
!	analysis utility.
!
! Usage:
!	DAVE inputfile [listingfile]
!
! Remarks:
!	The default extension for the inputfile is ".FOR", for the
!	listingfile, ".LST".  The listing file contains FORTRAN
!	carriage-control characters in column 1, and should 
!	therefore be run through the FORPTX utility before 
!	printing.  It is formatted to use no more than 80
!	characters per line.
!
!	Until PCL is given the ability to test for the existence
!	of arbitrary files, DAVE will receive its options from
!	a file "UTAH:DAVE.DEF" which contains the option SI=ON,
!	forcing continuation even if there are missing routines.
!	The user may provide alternate options in a file of the
!	same name on the connected directory, provided the logical
!	name UTAH: is redefined to be DSK:,UTAH:.
!
!	DAVE creates temporary files with the names FORnn.DAT in
!	the connected directory, where nn = 01..13, as well as files
!	named PAGEI.DAV, PAGEM.DAV, and ROLL.DAV; these are deleted
!	at normal termination, but might be left if DAVE is aborted.
